| **[LIBERO-Plus: In-depth Robustness Analysis of Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13626v3)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models report impressive success rates on robotic manipulation benchmarks, yet these results may mask fundamental weaknesses in robustness. We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout, camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.</p></details> |  |
| **[StereoVLA: Enhancing Vision-Language-Action Models with Stereo Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21970v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo cameras closely mimic human binocular vision, providing rich spatial cues critical for precise robotic manipulation. Despite their advantage, the adoption of stereo vision in vision-language-action models (VLAs) remains underexplored. In this work, we present StereoVLA, a VLA model that leverages rich geometric cues from stereo vision. We propose a novel Geometric-Semantic Feature Extraction module that utilizes vision foundation models to extract and fuse two key features: 1) geometric features from subtle stereo-view differences for spatial perception; 2) semantic-rich features from the monocular view for instruction following. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary Interaction-Region Depth Estimation task to further enhance spatial perception and accelerate model convergence. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms baselines by a large margin in diverse tasks under the stereo setting and demonstrates strong robustness to camera pose variations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motus: A Unified Latent Action World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13030v2)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While a general embodied agent must function as a unified system, current methods are built on isolated models for understanding, world modeling, and control. This fragmentation prevents unifying multimodal generative capabilities and hinders learning from large-scale, heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose Motus, a unified latent action world model that leverages existing general pretrained models and rich, sharable motion information. Motus introduces a Mixture-of-Transformer (MoT) architecture to integrate three experts (i.e., understanding, video generation, and action) and adopts a UniDiffuser-style scheduler to enable flexible switching between different modeling modes (i.e., world models, vision-language-action models, inverse dynamics models, video generation models, and video-action joint prediction models). Motus further leverages the optical flow to learn latent actions and adopts a recipe with three-phase training pipeline and six-layer data pyramid, thereby extracting pixel-level "delta action" and enabling large-scale action pretraining. Experiments show that Motus achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation (a +15% improvement over X-VLA and a +45% improvement over Pi0.5) and real-world scenarios(improved by +11~48%), demonstrating unified modeling of all functionalities and priors significantly benefits downstream robotic tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[STARE-VLA: Progressive Stage-Aware Reinforcement for Fine-Tuning Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05107v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, powered by large language models and reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, have shown remarkable progress in robotic manipulation. Existing methods often treat long-horizon actions as linguistic sequences and apply trajectory-level optimization methods such as Trajectory-wise Preference Optimization (TPO) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), leading to coarse credit assignment and unstable training. However, unlike language, where a unified semantic meaning is preserved despite flexible sentence order, action trajectories progress through causally chained stages with different learning difficulties. This motivates progressive stage optimization. Thereby, we present Stage-Aware Reinforcement (STARE), a module that decomposes a long-horizon action trajectory into semantically meaningful stages and provides dense, interpretable, and stage-aligned reinforcement signals. Integrating STARE into TPO and PPO, we yield Stage-Aware TPO (STA-TPO) and Stage-Aware PPO (STA-PPO) for offline stage-wise preference and online intra-stage interaction, respectively. Further building on supervised fine-tuning as initialization, we propose the Imitation -> Preference -> Interaction (IPI), a serial fine-tuning pipeline for improving action accuracy in VLA models. Experiments on SimplerEnv and ManiSkill3 demonstrate substantial gains, achieving state-of-the-art success rates of 98.0 percent on SimplerEnv and 96.4 percent on ManiSkill3 tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Large Model: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08189v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and visual intelligence have enabled agents that not only perceive complex visual scenes but also reason, generate, and act within them. This survey offers a critical and up-to-date synthesis of the field. We first formalize visual RL problems and trace the evolution of policy-optimization strategies from RLHF to verifiable reward paradigms, and from Proximal Policy Optimization to Group Relative Policy Optimization. We then organize more than 200 representative works into four thematic pillars: multi-modal large language models, visual generation, unified model frameworks, and vision-language-action models. For each pillar we examine algorithmic design, reward engineering, benchmark progress, and we distill trends such as curriculum-driven training, preference-aligned diffusion, and unified reward modeling. Finally, we review evaluation protocols spanning set-level fidelity, sample-level preference, and state-level stability, and we identify open challenges that include sample efficiency, generalization, and safe deployment. Our goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a coherent map of the rapidly expanding landscape of visual RL and to highlight promising directions for future inquiry.

| **[ActionFlow: A Pipelined Action Acceleration for Vision Language Models on Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20276v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a unified paradigm for robotic perception and control, enabling emergent generalization and long-horizon task execution. However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware. Our work is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ActionFlow-1D47.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Vision-Language-Action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment for Behavioral Cloning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14396v5)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-conditioned manipulation facilitates human-robot interaction via behavioral cloning (BC), which learns control policies from human demonstrations and serves as a cornerstone of embodied AI. Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026, the Project website is available at https://qhemu.github.io/CCoL/</p></details> |
| **[Asynchronous Fast-Slow Vision-Language-Action Policies for Whole-Body Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20188v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for semantic reasoning with an action expert generating continuous action signals, yet both typically run at a single unified frequency. As a result, policy performance is constrained by the low inference speed of large VLMs. This mandatory synchronous execution severely limits control stability and real-time performance in whole-body robotic manipulation, which involves more joints, larger motion spaces, and dynamically changing views. We introduce a truly asynchronous Fast-Slow VLA framework (DuoCore-FS), organizing the system into a fast pathway for high-frequency action generation and a slow pathway for rich VLM reasoning. The system is characterized by two key features. First, a latent representation buffer bridges the slow and fast systems. It stores instruction semantics and action-reasoning representation aligned with the scene-instruction context, providing high-level guidance to the fast pathway. Second, a whole-body action tokenizer provides a compact, unified representation of whole-body actions. Importantly, the VLM and action expert are still jointly trained end-to-end, preserving unified policy learning while enabling asynchronous execution. DuoCore-FS supports a 3B-parameter VLM while achieving 30 Hz whole-body action-chunk generation, approximately three times as fast as prior VLA models with comparable model sizes. Real-world whole-body manipulation experiments demonstrate improved task success rates and significantly enhanced responsiveness compared to synchronous Fast-Slow VLA baselines. The implementation of DuoCore-FS, including training, inference, and deployment, is provided to commercial users by Astribot as part of the Astribot robotic platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoLA: Long Horizon Latent Action Learning for General Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20166v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capability of performing long-horizon, language-guided robotic manipulation tasks critically relies on leveraging historical information and generating coherent action sequences. However, such capabilities are often overlooked by existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. To solve this challenge, we propose LoLA (Long Horizon Latent Action Learning), a framework designed for robot manipulation that integrates long-term multi-view observations and robot proprioception to enable multi-step reasoning and action generation. We first employ Vision-Language Models to encode rich contextual features from historical sequences and multi-view observations. We further introduces a key module, State-Aware Latent Re-representation, which transforms visual inputs and language commands into actionable robot motion space. Unlike existing VLA approaches that merely concatenate robot proprioception (e.g., joint angles) with VL embeddings, this module leverages such robot states to explicitly ground VL representations in physical scale through a learnable "embodiment-anchored" latent space. We trained LoLA on diverse robotic pre-training datasets and conducted extensive evaluations on simulation benchmarks (SIMPLER and LIBERO), as well as two real-world tasks on Franka and Bi-Manual Aloha robots. Results show that LoLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods (e.g., pi0), particularly in long-horizon manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bring My Cup! Personalizing Vision-Language-Action Models with Visual Attentive Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20014v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models generalize well to generic instructions, they struggle with personalized commands such as "bring my cup", where the robot must act on one specific instance among visually similar objects. We study this setting of manipulating personal objects, in which a VLA must identify and control a user-specific object unseen during training using only a few reference images. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Attentive Prompting (VAP), a simple-yet-effective training-free perceptual adapter that equips frozen VLAs with top-down selective attention. VAP treats the reference images as a non-parametric visual memory, grounds the personal object in the scene through open-vocabulary detection and embedding-based matching, and then injects this grounding as a visual prompt by highlighting the object and rewriting the instruction. We construct two simulation benchmarks, Personalized-SIMPLER and Personalized-VLABench, and a real-world tabletop benchmark to evaluate personalized manipulation across multiple robots and tasks. Experiments show that VAP consistently outperforms generic policies and token-learning baselines in both success rate and correct-object manipulation, helping to bridge the gap between semantic understanding and instance-level control.</p></details> |  |
| **[GR-RL: Going Dexterous and Precise for Long-Horizon Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01801v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GR-RL, a robotic learning framework that turns a generalist vision-language-action (VLA) policy into a highly capable specialist for long-horizon dexterous manipulation. Assuming the optimality of human demonstrations is core to existing VLA policies. However, we claim that in highly dexterous and precise manipulation tasks, human demonstrations are noisy and suboptimal. GR-RL proposes a multi-stage training pipeline that filters, augments, and reinforces the demonstrations by reinforcement learning. First, GR-RL learns a vision-language-conditioned task progress, filters the demonstration trajectories, and only keeps the transitions that contribute positively to the progress. Specifically, we show that by directly applying offline RL with sparse reward, the resulting $Q$-values can be treated as a robust progress function. Next, we introduce morphological symmetry augmentation that greatly improves the generalization and performance of GR-RL. Lastly, to better align the VLA policy with its deployment behaviors for high-precision control, we perform online RL by learning a latent space noise predictor. With this pipeline, GR-RL is, to our knowledge, the first learning-based policy that can autonomously lace up a shoe by threading shoelaces through multiple eyelets with an 83.3% success rate, a task requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and compliant soft-body interaction. We hope GR-RL provides a step toward enabling generalist robot foundation models to specialize into reliable real-world experts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion VLA: Bringing Discrete Diffusion to Action Decoding in Vision-Language-Action Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20072v3)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models adapt large vision-language backbones to map images and instructions into robot actions. However, prevailing VLAs either generate actions auto-regressively in a fixed left-to-right order or attach separate MLP or diffusion heads outside the backbone, leading to fragmented information pathways and specialized training requirements that hinder a unified, scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a unified-transformer policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion. The design retains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively compatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an adaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones and uses secondary re-masking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement rounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This unified decoder preserves pre-trained vision-language priors, supports parallel decoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number of function evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg. success rates on LIBERO, 71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv-Fractal and 54.2% overall on SimplerEnv-Bridge. We also provide ablation study on vision-language ability retention on LIBERO-OOD (Out-of-Distribution) benchmark, with our method improving over autoregressive, MLP decoder and continuous diffusion baselines. These findings indicate that discrete-diffusion VLA supports precise action modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to larger models and datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/Liang-ZX/DiscreteDiffusionVLA/tree/libero.</p></details> | <details><summary>New e...</summary><p>New experiments on VL retention and new ablations. 18 pages</p></details> |
| **[REALM: A Real-to-Sim Validated Benchmark for Generalization in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19562v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models empower robots to understand and execute tasks described by natural language instructions. However, a key challenge lies in their ability to generalize beyond the specific environments and conditions they were trained on, which is presently difficult and expensive to evaluate in the real-world. To address this gap, we present REALM, a new simulation environment and benchmark designed to evaluate the generalization capabilities of VLA models, with a specific emphasis on establishing a strong correlation between simulated and real-world performance through high-fidelity visuals and aligned robot control. Our environment offers a suite of 15 perturbation factors, 7 manipulation skills, and more than 3,500 objects. Finally, we establish two task sets that form our benchmark and evaluate the π_{0}, π_{0}-FAST, and GR00T N1.5 VLA models, showing that generalization and robustness remain an open challenge. More broadly, we also show that simulation gives us a valuable proxy for the real-world and allows us to systematically probe for and quantify the weaknesses and failure modes of VLAs.

| **[Confidence Calibration in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17383v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthy robot behavior requires not only high levels of task success but also that the robot can reliably quantify how likely it is to succeed. To this end, we present a first-of-its-kind study of confidence calibration in vision-language-action (VLA) foundation models, which map visual observations and natural language instructions to low-level robot motor commands. We establish a confidence baseline for VLAs, examine how task success relates to calibration error and how calibration evolves over time, and introduce two lightweight techniques to remedy the miscalibration we observe: prompt ensembles and action-wise Platt scaling. Our aim in this study is to begin to develop the tools and conceptual understanding necessary to render VLAs both highly performant and highly trustworthy via reliable uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 19 figures; additional experiments with VLA variants</p></details> |
| **[QDepth-VLA: Quantized Depth Prediction as Auxiliary Supervision for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14836v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential 3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder, enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Point What You Mean: Visually Grounded Instruction Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18933v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models align vision and language with embodied control, but their object referring ability remains limited when relying solely on text prompt, especially in cluttered or out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes. In this study, we introduce the Point-VLA, a plug-and-play policy that augments language instructions with explicit visual cues (e.g., bounding boxes) to resolve referential ambiguity and enable precise object-level grounding. To efficiently scale visually grounded datasets, we further develop an automatic data annotation pipeline requiring minimal human effort. We evaluate Point-VLA on diverse real-world referring tasks and observe consistently stronger performance than text-only instruction VLAs, particularly in cluttered or unseen-object scenarios, with robust generalization. These results demonstrate that Point-VLA effectively resolves object referring ambiguity through pixel-level visual grounding, achieving more generalizable embodied control.</p></details> |  |

Building on the Pi0.5 architecture, we introduce several innovations. Our primary contribution is correlated noise for flow matching, which improves training efficiency and enables correlation-aware inpainting for smooth action sequences. We also apply learnable mixed-layer attention and System 2 stage tracking for ambiguity resolution. Training employs multi-sample flow matching to reduce variance, while inference uses action compression and challenge-specific correction rules. Our approach achieves 26% q-score across all 50 tasks on both public and private leaderboards.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 NeurIPS Behavior Challenge 1st place solution</p></details> |

Unlike prior Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that rely on abstract latent dynamics or delegate reasoning to language components, STORM grounds planning in explicit visual rollouts, enabling interpretable and foresight-driven decision-making. A diffusion-based VLA policy proposes diverse candidate actions, a generative video world model simulates their visual and reward outcomes, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) selectively refines plans through lookahead evaluation. Experiments on the SimplerEnv manipulation benchmark demonstrate that STORM achieves a new state-of-the-art average success rate of 51.0 percent, outperforming strong baselines such as CogACT. Reward-augmented video prediction substantially improves spatio-temporal fidelity and task relevance, reducing Frechet Video Distance by over 75 percent. Moreover, STORM exhibits robust re-planning and failure recovery behavior, highlighting the advantages of search-guided generative world models for long-horizon robotic manipulation.</p></details> | Under submission |

However, Successful execution of such tasks depends on large, costly collections of real demonstrations, especially for fine-grained manipulation of articulated objects. To address this, we present AOMGen, a scalable data generation framework for articulated manipulation which is instantiated from a single real scan, demonstration and a library of readily available digital assets, yielding photoreal training data with verified physical states. The framework synthesizes synchronized multi-view RGB temporally aligned with action commands and state annotations for joints and contacts, and systematically varies camera viewpoints, object styles, and object poses to expand a single execution into a diverse corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning VLA policies on AOMGen data increases the success rate from 0% to 88.7%, and the policies are tested on unseen objects and layouts.</p></details> |  |

While multi-modal sensor fusion provides comprehensive situational awareness yet robots must also contextualize their reasoning to achieve deep semantic understanding of complex scenes. Foundation model particularly Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as promising approach on integrating diverse perceptual modalities and spatio-temporal reasoning abilities to ground physical actions to realize General Physical Intelligence (GPI) across various robotic embodiments. Although GPI has been conceptually discussed in literature but its pivotal role and practical deployment in agile manufacturing remain underexplored. To address this gap, this practical review systematically surveys recent advances in VLA models through the lens of GPI by offering comparative analysis of leading implementations and evaluating their industrial readiness via structured ablation study. The state of the art is organized into six thematic pillars including multisensory representation learning, sim2real transfer, planning and control, uncertainty and safety measures and benchmarking. Finally, the review highlights open challenges and future directions for integrating GPI into industrial ecosystems to align with the vision of Industry 5.0 for intelligent, adaptive and collaborative manufacturing ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Advan...</summary><p>Advanced Engineering Informatics</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel VLA approach that leverages the competitive performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 2D images to directly infer robot end-effector poses in image frame coordinates. Unlike prior VLA models that output low-level controls, our model predicts trajectory waypoints, making it both more efficient to train and robot embodiment agnostic. Despite its lightweight design, our next-token prediction architecture effectively learns meaningful and executable robot trajectories. We further explore the underutilized potential of incorporating depth images, inference-time techniques such as decoding strategies, and demonstration-conditioned action generation. Our model is trained on a simulated dataset and exhibits strong sim-to-real transfer capabilities. We evaluate our approach using a combination of simulated and real data, demonstrating its effectiveness on a real robotic system.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures; CoRL 2025 Workshop on Generalizable Priors for Robot Manipulation</p></details> |
| **[Robotic VLA Benefits from Joint Learning with Motion Image Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18007v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable progress in robotic manipulation by mapping multimodal observations and instructions directly to actions. However, they typically mimic expert trajectories without predictive motion reasoning, which limits their ability to reason about what actions to take. To address this limitation, we propose joint learning with motion image diffusion, a novel strategy that enhances VLA models with motion reasoning capabilities. Our method extends the VLA architecture with a dual-head design: while the action head predicts action chunks as in vanilla VLAs, an additional motion head, implemented as a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), predicts optical-flow-based motion images that capture future dynamics. The two heads are trained jointly, enabling the shared VLM backbone to learn representations that couple robot control with motion knowledge. This joint learning builds temporally coherent and physically grounded representations without modifying the inference pathway of standard VLAs, thereby maintaining test-time latency. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that joint learning with motion image diffusion improves the success rate of pi-series VLAs to 97.5% on the LIBERO benchmark and 58.0% on the RoboTwin benchmark, yielding a 23% improvement in real-world performance and validating its effectiveness in enhancing the motion reasoning capability of large-scale VLAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://vla-motion.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[mimic-video: Video-Action Models for Generalizable Robot Control Beyond VLAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15692v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevailing Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) for robotic manipulation are built upon vision-language backbones pretrained on large-scale, but disconnected static web data. As a result, despite improved semantic generalization, the policy must implicitly infer complex physical dynamics and temporal dependencies solely from robot trajectories. This reliance creates an unsustainable data burden, necessitating continuous, large-scale expert data collection to compensate for the lack of innate physical understanding. We contend that while vision-language pretraining effectively captures semantic priors, it remains blind to physical causality. A more effective paradigm leverages video to jointly capture semantics and visual dynamics during pretraining, thereby isolating the remaining task of low-level control. To this end, we introduce mimic-video, a novel Video-Action Model (VAM) that pairs a pretrained Internet-scale video model with a flow matching-based action decoder conditioned on its latent representations. The decoder serves as an Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM), generating low-level robot actions from the latent representation of video-space action plans. Our extensive evaluation shows that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, improving sample efficiency by 10x and convergence speed by 2x compared to traditional VLA architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised Introduction, Related Work, and Appendix.

VLA-AN addresses four major limitations of existing large aerial navigation models: the data domain gap, insufficient temporal navigation with reasoning, safety issues with generative action policies, and onboard deployment constraints. First, we construct a high-fidelity dataset utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) to effectively bridge the domain gap. Second, we introduce a progressive three-stage training framework that sequentially reinforces scene comprehension, core flight skills, and complex navigation capabilities. Third, we design a lightweight, real-time action module coupled with geometric safety correction. This module ensures fast, collision-free, and stable command generation, mitigating the safety risks inherent in stochastic generative policies. Finally, through deep optimization of the onboard deployment pipeline, VLA-AN achieves a robust real-time 8.3x improvement in inference throughput on resource-constrained UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLA-AN significantly improves spatial grounding, scene reasoning, and long-horizon navigation, achieving a maximum single-task success rate of 98.1%, and providing an efficient, practical solution for realizing full-chain closed-loop autonomy in lightweight aerial robots.</p></details> |  |

This field is exploding with new models and datasets, making it both exciting and challenging to keep pace with. This survey offers a clear and structured guide to the VLA landscape. We design it to follow the natural learning path of a researcher: we start with the basic Modules of any VLA model, trace the history through key Milestones, and then dive deep into the core Challenges that define recent research frontier. Our main contribution is a detailed breakdown of the five biggest challenges in: (1) Representation, (2) Execution, (3) Generalization, (4) Safety, and (5) Dataset and Evaluation. This structure mirrors the developmental roadmap of a generalist agent: establishing the fundamental perception-action loop, scaling capabilities across diverse embodiments and environments, and finally ensuring trustworthy deployment-all supported by the essential data infrastructure. For each of them, we review existing approaches and highlight future opportunities. We position this paper as both a foundational guide for newcomers and a strategic roadmap for experienced researchers, with the dual aim of accelerating learning and inspiring new ideas in embodied intelligence.

To overcome this limitation, we propose MiVLA, a generalizable VLA empowered by human-robot mutual imitation pre-training, which leverages inherent behavioral similarity between human hands and robotic arms to build a foundation of strong behavioral priors for both human actions and robotic control. Specifically, our method utilizes kinematic rules with left/right hand coordinate systems for bidirectional alignment between human and robot action spaces. Given human or simulated robot demonstrations, MiVLA is trained to forecast behavior trajectories for one embodiment, and imitate behaviors for another one unseen in the demonstration. Based on this mutual imitation, it integrates the behavioral fidelity of real-world human data with the manipulative diversity of simulated robot data into a unified model, thereby enhancing the generalization capability for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on both simulation and real-world platforms with three robots (ARX, PiPer and LocoMan), demonstrate that MiVLA achieves strong improved generalization capability, outperforming state-of-the-art VLAs (e.g., $\boldsymbolπ_{0}$, $\boldsymbolπ_{0.5}$ and H-RDT) by 25% in simulation, and 14% in real-world robot control tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phantom Menace: Exploring and Enhancing the Robustness of VLA Models Against Physical Sensor Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10008v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models revolutionize robotic systems by enabling end-to-end perception-to-action pipelines that integrate multiple sensory modalities, such as visual signals processed by cameras and auditory signals captured by microphones. This multi-modality integration allows VLA models to interpret complex, real-world environments using diverse sensor data streams. Given the fact that VLA-based systems heavily rely on the sensory input, the security of VLA models against physical-world sensor attacks remains critically underexplored. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of physical sensor attacks against VLAs, quantifying the influence of sensor attacks and investigating the defenses for VLA models. We introduce a novel "Real-Sim-Real" framework that automatically simulates physics-based sensor attack vectors, including six attacks targeting cameras and two targeting microphones, and validates them on real robotic systems. Through large-scale evaluations across various VLA architectures and tasks under varying attack parameters, we demonstrate significant vulnerabilities, with susceptibility patterns that reveal critical dependencies on task types and model designs. We further develop an adversarial-training-based defense that enhances VLA robustness against out-of-distribution physical perturbations caused by sensor attacks while preserving model performance. Our findings expose an urgent need for standardized robustness benchmarks and mitigation strategies to secure VLA deployments in safety-critical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 main track</p></details> |
| **[GeoPredict: Leveraging Predictive Kinematics and 3D Gaussian Geometry for Precise VLA Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16811v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models achieve strong generalization in robotic manipulation but remain largely reactive and 2D-centric, making them unreliable in tasks that require precise 3D reasoning. We propose GeoPredict, a geometry-aware VLA framework that augments a continuous-action policy with predictive kinematic and geometric priors. GeoPredict introduces a trajectory-level module that encodes motion history and predicts multi-step 3D keypoint trajectories of robot arms, and a predictive 3D Gaussian geometry module that forecasts workspace geometry with track-guided refinement along future keypoint trajectories. These predictive modules serve exclusively as training-time supervision through depth-based rendering, while inference requires only lightweight additional query tokens without invoking any 3D decoding. Experiments on RoboCasa Human-50, LIBERO, and real-world manipulation tasks show that GeoPredict consistently outperforms strong VLA baselines, especially in geometry-intensive and spatially demanding scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-Language-Action Models for Autonomous Driving: Past, Present, and Future](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16760v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving has long relied on modular "Perception-Decision-Action" pipelines, where hand-crafted interfaces and rule-based components often break down in complex or long-tailed scenarios. Their cascaded design further propagates perception errors, degrading downstream planning and control. Vision-Action (VA) models address some limitations by learning direct mappings from visual inputs to actions, but they remain opaque, sensitive to distribution shifts, and lack structured reasoning or instruction-following capabilities. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal learning has motivated the emergence of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks, which integrate perception with language-grounded decision making. By unifying visual understanding, linguistic reasoning, and actionable outputs, VLAs offer a pathway toward more interpretable, generalizable, and human-aligned driving policies. This work provides a structured characterization of the emerging VLA landscape for autonomous driving. We trace the evolution from early VA approaches to modern VLA frameworks and organize existing methods into two principal paradigms: End-to-End VLA, which integrates perception, reasoning, and planning within a single model, and Dual-System VLA, which separates slow deliberation (via VLMs) from fast, safety-critical execution (via planners). Within these paradigms, we further distinguish subclasses such as textual vs. numerical action generators and explicit vs. implicit guidance mechanisms. We also summarize representative datasets and benchmarks for evaluating VLA-based driving systems and highlight key challenges and open directions, including robustness, interpretability, and instruction fidelity. Overall, this work aims to establish a coherent foundation for advancing human-compatible autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 40 pages, 7 figures, 9 tables; GitHub at https://github.com/worldbench/awesome-vla-for-ad</p></details> |
| **[Robust Finetuning of Vision-Language-Action Robot Policies via Parameter Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08333v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist robot policies, trained on large and diverse datasets, have demonstrated the ability to generalize across a wide spectrum of behaviors, enabling a single policy to act in varied real-world environments. However, they still fall short on new tasks not covered in the training data. When finetuned on limited demonstrations of a new task, these policies often overfit to the specific demonstrations--not only losing their prior abilities to solve a wide variety of generalist tasks but also failing to generalize within the new task itself. In this work, we aim to develop a method that preserves the generalization capabilities of the generalist policy during finetuning, allowing a single policy to robustly incorporate a new skill into its repertoire. Our goal is a single policy that both learns to generalize to variations of the new task and retains the broad competencies gained from pretraining. We show that this can be achieved through a simple yet effective strategy: interpolating the weights of a finetuned model with that of the pretrained model. We show, across extensive simulated and real-world experiments, that such model merging produces a single model that inherits the generalist abilities of the base model and learns to solve the new task robustly, outperforming both the pretrained and finetuned model on out-of-distribution variations of the new task. Moreover, we show that model merging performance scales with the amount of pretraining data, and enables continual acquisition of new skills in a lifelong learning setting, without sacrificing previously learned generalist abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[DriveVLA-W0: World Models Amplify Data Scaling Law in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12796v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However, VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose \textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment. We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a 680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Video Planner Enables Generalizable Robot Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15840v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General-purpose robots require decision-making models that generalize across diverse tasks and environments. Recent works build robot foundation models by extending multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with action outputs, creating vision-language-action (VLA) systems. These efforts are motivated by the intuition that MLLMs' large-scale language and image pretraining can be effectively transferred to the action output modality. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm of using large-scale video pretraining as a primary modality for building robot foundation models. Unlike static images and language, videos capture spatio-temporal sequences of states and actions in the physical world that are naturally aligned with robotic behavior. We curate an internet-scale video dataset of human activities and task demonstrations, and train, for the first time at a foundation-model scale, an open video model for generative robotics planning. The model produces zero-shot video plans for novel scenes and tasks, which we post-process to extract executable robot actions. We evaluate task-level generalization through third-party selected tasks in the wild and real-robot experiments, demonstrating successful physical execution. Together, these results show robust instruction following, strong generalization, and real-world feasibility. We release both the model and dataset to support open, reproducible video-based robot learning.

| **[EVOLVE-VLA: Test-Time Training from Environment Feedback for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14666v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving truly adaptive embodied intelligence requires agents that learn not just by imitating static demonstrations, but by continuously improving through environmental interaction, which is akin to how humans master skills through practice. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic manipulation by leveraging large language models, yet remain fundamentally limited by Supervised Finetuning (SFT): requiring hundreds of demonstrations per task, rigidly memorizing trajectories, and failing to adapt when deployment conditions deviate from training. We introduce EVOLVE-VLA, a test-time training framework enabling VLAs to continuously adapt through environment interaction with minimal or zero task-specific demonstrations. The key technical challenge is replacing oracle reward signals (unavailable at test time) with autonomous feedback. We address this through a learned progress estimator providing dense feedback, and critically, we design our framework to ``tame'' this inherently noisy signal via two mechanisms: (1) an accumulative progress estimation mechanism smoothing noisy point-wise estimates, and (2) a progressive horizon extension strategy enabling gradual policy evolution. EVOLVE-VLA achieves substantial gains: +8.6\% on long-horizon tasks, +22.0\% in 1-shot learning, and enables cross-task generalization -- achieving 20.8\% success on unseen tasks without task-specific demonstrations training (vs. 0\% for pure SFT). Qualitative analysis reveals emergent capabilities absent in demonstrations, including error recovery and novel strategies. This work represents a critical step toward VLAs that truly learn and adapt, moving beyond static imitation toward continuous self-improvements.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[MindDrive: A Vision-Language-Action Model for Autonomous Driving via Online Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13636v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion. Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. Using the lightweight Qwen-0.5B LLM, MindDrive achieves Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and Success Rate (SR) of 55.09% on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables; Project Page: https://xiaomi-mlab.github.io/MindDrive/</p></details> |
| **[Sample-Efficient Robot Skill Learning for Construction Tasks: Benchmarking Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and Vision-Language-Action VLA Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14031v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluates two leading approaches for teaching construction robots new skills to understand their applicability for construction automation: a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. The goal is to understand both task performance and the practical effort needed to deploy each approach on real jobs. The authors developed two teleoperation interfaces to control the robots and collect the demonstrations needed, both of which proved effective for training robots for long-horizon and dexterous tasks. In addition, the authors conduct a three-stage evaluation. First, the authors compare a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) policy with a Deep Q-network (DQN) imitation model to identify the stronger RL baseline, focusing on model performance, generalization, and a pick-up experiment. Second, three different VLA models are trained in two different scenarios and compared with each other. Third, the authors benchmark the selected RL baseline against the VLA model using computational and sample-efficiency measures and then a robot experiment on a multi-stage panel installation task that includes transport and installation. The VLA model demonstrates strong generalization and few-shot capability, achieving 60% and 100% success in the pickup phase. In comparison, DQN can be made robust but needs additional noise during tuning, which increases the workload. Overall, the findings indicate that VLA offers practical advantages for changing tasks by reducing programming effort and enabling useful performance with minimal data, while DQN provides a viable baseline when sufficient tuning effort is acceptable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Aware VLA Pretraining through Visual-Physical Alignment from Human Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13080v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models provide a promising paradigm for robot learning by integrating visual perception with language-guided policy learning. However, most existing approaches rely on 2D visual inputs to perform actions in 3D physical environments, creating a significant gap between perception and action grounding. To bridge this gap, we propose a Spatial-Aware VLA Pretraining paradigm that performs explicit alignment between visual space and physical space during pretraining, enabling models to acquire 3D spatial understanding before robot policy learning. Starting from pretrained vision-language models, we leverage large-scale human demonstration videos to extract 3D visual and 3D action annotations, forming a new source of supervision that aligns 2D visual observations with 3D spatial reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with VIPA-VLA, a dual-encoder architecture that incorporates a 3D visual encoder to augment semantic visual representations with 3D-aware features. When adapted to downstream robot tasks, VIPA-VLA achieves significantly improved grounding between 2D vision and 3D action, resulting in more robust and generalizable robotic policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[WholeBodyVLA: Towards Unified Latent VLA for Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11047v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots require precise locomotion and dexterous manipulation to perform challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Yet existing approaches, modular or end-to-end, are deficient in manipulation-aware locomotion. This confines the robot to a limited workspace, preventing it from performing large-space loco-manipulation. We attribute this to: (1) the challenge of acquiring loco-manipulation knowledge due to the scarcity of humanoid teleoperation data, and (2) the difficulty of faithfully and reliably executing locomotion commands, stemming from the limited precision and stability of existing RL controllers. To acquire richer loco-manipulation knowledge, we propose a unified latent learning framework that enables Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system to learn from low-cost action-free egocentric videos. Moreover, an efficient human data collection pipeline is devised to augment the dataset and scale the benefits. To execute the desired locomotion commands more precisely, we present a loco-manipulation-oriented (LMO) RL policy specifically tailored for accurate and stable core loco-manipulation movements, such as advancing, turning, and squatting. Building on these components, we introduce WholeBodyVLA, a unified framework for humanoid loco-manipulation. To the best of our knowledge, WholeBodyVLA is one of its kind enabling large-space humanoid loco-manipulation. It is verified via comprehensive experiments on the AgiBot X2 humanoid, outperforming prior baseline by 21.3%. It also demonstrates strong generalization and high extensibility across a broad range of tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DrivePI: Spatial-aware 4D MLLM for Unified Autonomous Driving Understanding, Perception, Prediction and Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12799v1)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities across diverse domains, their application in generating fine-grained 3D perception and prediction outputs in autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose DrivePI, a novel spatial-aware 4D MLLM that serves as a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework that is also compatible with vision-action (VA) models. Our method jointly performs spatial understanding, 3D perception (i.e., 3D occupancy), prediction (i.e., occupancy flow), and planning (i.e., action outputs) in parallel through end-to-end optimization. To obtain both precise geometric information and rich visual appearance, our approach integrates point clouds, multi-view images, and language instructions within a unified MLLM architecture. We further develop a data engine to generate text-occupancy and text-flow QA pairs for 4D spatial understanding. Remarkably, with only a 0.5B Qwen2.5 model as MLLM backbone, DrivePI as a single unified model matches or exceeds both existing VLA models and specialized VA models. Specifically, compared to VLA models, DrivePI outperforms OpenDriveVLA-7B by 2.5% mean accuracy on nuScenes-QA and reduces collision rate by 70% over ORION (from 0.37% to 0.11%) on nuScenes. Against specialized VA models, DrivePI surpasses FB-OCC by 10.3 RayIoU for 3D occupancy on OpenOcc, reduces the mAVE from 0.591 to 0.509 for occupancy flow on OpenOcc, and achieves 32% lower L2 error than VAD (from 0.72m to 0.49m) for planning on nuScenes.

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show potential in learning skills from demonstrations, their scalability is limited by scarce high-quality training data. Existing data collection methods face inherent constraints: manual teleoperation overloads human operators, while automated planning often produces unnatural motions. We propose a Shared Autonomy framework that divides control between macro and micro motions. A human operator guides the robot's arm pose through intuitive VR teleoperation, while an autonomous DexGrasp-VLA policy handles fine-grained hand control using real-time tactile and visual feedback. This division significantly reduces cognitive load and enables efficient collection of high-quality coordinated arm-hand demonstrations. Using this data, we train an end-to-end VLA policy enhanced with our novel Arm-Hand Feature Enhancement module, which captures both distinct and shared representations of macro and micro movements for more natural coordination. Our Corrective Teleoperation system enables continuous policy improvement through human-in-the-loop failure recovery. Experiments demonstrate that our framework generates high-quality data with minimal manpower and achieves a 90% success rate across diverse objects, including unseen instances. Comprehensive evaluations validate the system's effectiveness in developing dexterous manipulation capabilities.</p></details> |  |

We present BLURR, a lightweight inference wrapper that can be plugged into existing VLA controllers without retraining or changing model checkpoints. Instantiated on the pi-zero VLA controller, BLURR keeps the original observation interfaces and accelerates control by combining an instruction prefix key value cache, mixed precision execution, and a single step rollout schedule that reduces per step computation. In our SimplerEnv based evaluation, BLURR maintains task success rates comparable to the original controller while significantly lowering effective FLOPs and wall clock latency. We also build an interactive web demo that allows users to switch between controllers and toggle inference options in real time while watching manipulation episodes. This highlights BLURR as a practical approach for deploying modern VLA policies under tight compute budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures.

However, with the rapid evolution of machine intelligence, the target of compression has shifted from task-specific virtual models to Embodied agents operating in real-world environments. To address the communication constraints of Embodied AI in multi-agent systems and ensure real-time task execution, this paper introduces, for the first time, the scientific problem of Embodied Image Compression. We establish a standardized benchmark, EmbodiedComp, to facilitate systematic evaluation under ultra-low bitrate conditions in a closed-loop setting. Through extensive empirical studies in both simulated and real-world settings, we demonstrate that existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) fail to reliably perform even simple manipulation tasks when compressed below the Embodied bitrate threshold. We anticipate that EmbodiedComp will catalyze the development of domain-specific compression tailored for Embodied agents , thereby accelerating the Embodied AI deployment in the Real-world.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Using LIBERO demonstrations, AAS produces a validated dataset of 2,124 atomic segments labeled with action type, temporal span, and confidence. A stronger segmenter (Gemini 2.5 Pro) closely matches planner-defined plans and remains robust under keyframe jitter, while smaller models perform worse on multi-object tasks. Fine-tuning CLIP-RT+ on our atomic dataset improves task success from 94.2% to 95.3% on LIBERO-Goal and 83.8% to 88.8% on LIBERO-Long.

However, current evaluation practices remain fragmented across isolated benchmarks, making it difficult to assess whether today's foundation models truly generalize beyond their training distributions. We introduce MultiNet v1.0, a unified benchmark for measuring the cross domain generality of vision language models (VLMs) and vision language action models (VLAs) across six foundational capability regimes. Visual grounding, spatial reasoning, tool use, physical commonsense, multi agent coordination, and continuous robot control. Evaluating GPT 5, Pi0, and Magma, we find that no model demonstrates consistent generality. All exhibit substantial degradation on unseen domains, unfamiliar modalities, or cross domain task shifts despite strong performance within their training distributions.These failures manifest as modality misalignment, output format instability, and catastrophic knowledge degradation under domain transfer.Our findings reveal a persistent gap between the aspiration of generalist intelligence and the actual capabilities of current foundation models.MultiNet v1.0 provides a standardized evaluation substrate for diagnosing these gaps and guiding the development of future generalist agents.Code, data, and leaderboards are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Seeing to Act, Prompting to Specify: A Bayesian Factorization of Vision Language Action Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11218v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of out-of-distribution generalization in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models is often hindered by catastrophic forgetting of the Vision-Language Model (VLM) backbone during fine-tuning. While co-training with external reasoning data helps, it requires experienced tuning and data-related overhead. Beyond such external dependencies, we identify an intrinsic cause within VLA datasets: modality imbalance, where language diversity is much lower than visual and action diversity. This imbalance biases the model toward visual shortcuts and language forgetting. To address this, we introduce BayesVLA, a Bayesian factorization that decomposes the policy into a visual-action prior, supporting seeing-to-act, and a language-conditioned likelihood, enabling prompt-to-specify. This inherently preserves generalization and promotes instruction following. We further incorporate pre- and post-contact phases to better leverage pre-trained foundation models. Information-theoretic analysis formally validates our effectiveness in mitigating shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show superior generalization to unseen instructions, objects, and environments compared to existing methods.

This paper presents an efficient fine-tuning methodology and real-world deployment analysis for adapting VLA models to low-cost robotic manipulation systems.We propose a resource-efficient fine-tuning strategy using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and quantization techniques that enable multi-billion parameter VLA models ( 3.1B parameters) to run on consumer-grade GPUs with 8GB VRAM. Our methodology addresses the critical challenge of adapting pre-trained VLA models to new robot embodiments with limited demonstration data, focusing on the trade-offs between frozen and unfrozen vision encoders. Through real-world deployment on the SO101 robotic arm for a button-pressing manipulation task, we demonstrate that our approach achieves effective manipulation performance while maintaining computational efficiency. We provide detailed analysis of deployment challenges, failure modes, and the relationship between training data quantity and real-world performance,trained on 200 demonstration episodes.

Specifically, the approach combines a metric-aligned numerical tokenizer that preserves scalar geometry via triplet-margin learning, a geometry-aware flow objective and a simulator-guided GRPO alignment that integrates safety, ego progress, and comfort rewards while retaining parallel generation. A multi-stage adaptation converts a pre-trained auto-regressive backbone (Janus-1.5B) from causal decoding to non-causal flow model and strengthens road-scene competence through continued multimodal pretraining. Thanks to the inherent nature of consistency model training and parallel decoding inference, WAM-Flow achieves superior closed-loop performance against autoregressive and diffusion-based VLA baselines, with 1-step inference attaining 89.1 PDMS and 5-step inference reaching 90.3 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 benchmark. These results establish discrete flow matching as a new promising paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving. The code will be publicly available soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 11 figures.

To overcome these limitations, we propose RoboNeuron, a universal deployment framework for embodied intelligence. RoboNeuron is the first framework to deeply integrate the cognitive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models with the real-time execution backbone of the Robot Operating System (ROS). We utilize the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a semantic bridge, enabling the LLM to dynamically orchestrate underlying robotic tools. The framework establishes a highly modular architecture that strictly decouples sensing, reasoning, and control by leveraging ROS's unified communication interfaces. Crucially, we introduce an automated tool to translate ROS messages into callable MCP functions, significantly streamlining development. RoboNeuron significantly enhances cross-scenario adaptability and component flexibility, while establishing a systematic platform for horizontal performance benchmarking, laying a robust foundation for scalable real-world embodied applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Alignment Fails: Multimodal Adversarial Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16203v3)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Chain-of-Thought World Modeling for End-to-End Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10226v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving explore inference-time reasoning as a way to improve driving performance and safety in challenging scenarios. Most prior work uses natural language to express chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before producing driving actions. However, text may not be the most efficient representation for reasoning. In this work, we present Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive): a model that expresses CoT in a latent language that captures possible outcomes of the driving actions being considered. Our approach unifies CoT reasoning and decision making by representing both in an action-aligned latent space. Instead of natural language, the model reasons by interleaving (1) action-proposal tokens, which use the same vocabulary as the model's output actions; and (2) world model tokens, which are grounded in a learned latent world model and express future outcomes of these actions. We cold start latent CoT by supervising the model's action proposals and world model tokens based on ground-truth future rollouts of the scene. We then post-train with closed-loop reinforcement learning to strengthen reasoning capabilities. On a large-scale end-to-end driving benchmark, LCDrive achieves faster inference, better trajectory quality, and larger improvements from interactive reinforcement learning compared to both non-reasoning and text-reasoning baselines.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Recent advances in learning-based control have shown great potential in enabling robots to acquire and generalize complex manipulation skills in such environments, but ensuring safety, both during exploration and execution, remains a critical bottleneck for reliable real-world deployment. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of safe learning-based methods for robot contact-rich tasks. We categorize existing approaches into two main domains: safe exploration and safe execution. We review key techniques, including constrained reinforcement learning, risk-sensitive optimization, uncertainty-aware modeling, control barrier functions, and model predictive safety shields, and highlight how these methods incorporate prior knowledge, task structure, and online adaptation to balance safety and efficiency. A particular emphasis of this survey is on how these safe learning principles extend to and interact with emerging robotic foundation models, especially vision-language models (VLMs) and vision-language-action models (VLAs), which unify perception, language, and control for contact-rich manipulation. We discuss both the new safety opportunities enabled by VLM/VLA-based methods, such as language-level specification of constraints and multimodal grounding of safety signals, and the amplified risks and evaluation challenges they introduce. Finally, we outline current limitations and promising future directions toward deploying reliable, safety-aligned, and foundation-model-enabled robots in complex contact-rich environments.

However, collecting demonstration datasets is costly: it often requires access to robots and needs sustained effort in a tedious, long process. These factors limit the scale of data available for training policies. We aim to address this scalability challenge by involving a broader audience in a gamified data collection experience that is both accessible and motivating. Specifically, we develop a gamified remote teleoperation platform, RoboCade, to engage general users in collecting data that is beneficial for downstream policy training. To do this, we embed gamification strategies into the design of the system interface and data collection tasks. In the system interface, we include components such as visual feedback, sound effects, goal visualizations, progress bars, leaderboards, and badges. We additionally propose principles for constructing gamified tasks that have overlapping structure with useful downstream target tasks. We instantiate RoboCade on three manipulation tasks -- including spatial arrangement, scanning, and insertion. To illustrate the viability of gamified robot data collection, we collect a demonstration dataset through our platform, and show that co-training robot policies with this data can improve success rate on non-gamified target tasks (+16-56%). Further, we conduct a user study to validate that novice users find the gamified platform significantly more enjoyable than a standard non-gamified platform (+24%). These results highlight the promise of gamified data collection as a scalable, accessible, and engaging method for collecting demonstration data.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

Existing robotic and teleoperated intubation systems primarily focus on airway navigation and do not provide integrated control of endotracheal tube advancement or objective verification of tube depth relative to the carina. This paper presents the Robotic Intubation System (BRIS), a compact, human-in-the-loop platform designed to assist fiberoptic-guided intubation while enabling real-time, objective depth awareness. BRIS integrates a four-way steerable fiberoptic bronchoscope, an independent endotracheal tube advancement mechanism, and a camera-augmented mouthpiece compatible with standard clinical workflows. A learning-enabled closed-loop control framework leverages real-time shape sensing to map joystick inputs to distal bronchoscope tip motion in Cartesian space, providing stable and intuitive teleoperation under tendon nonlinearities and airway contact. Monocular endoscopic depth estimation is used to classify airway regions and provide interpretable, anatomy-aware guidance for safe tube positioning relative to the carina. The system is validated on high-fidelity airway mannequins under standard and difficult airway configurations, demonstrating reliable navigation and controlled tube placement. These results highlight BRIS as a step toward safer, more consistent, and clinically compatible robotic airway management.</p></details> |  |

| **[Think, Act, Learn: A Framework for Autonomous Robotic Agents using Closed-Loop Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19854v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotics has unlocked unprecedented capabilities in high-level task planning. However, most current systems operate in an open-loop fashion, where LLMs act as one-shot planners, rendering them brittle and unable to adapt to unforeseen circumstances in dynamic physical environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the "Think, Act, Learn" (T-A-L) framework, a novel architecture that enables an embodied agent to autonomously learn and refine its policies through continuous interaction. Our framework establishes a closed-loop cycle where an LLM first "thinks" by decomposing high-level commands into actionable plans. The robot then "acts" by executing these plans while gathering rich, multimodal sensory feedback. Critically, the "learn" module processes this feedback to facilitate LLM-driven self-reflection, allowing the agent to perform causal analysis on its failures and generate corrective strategies. These insights are stored in an experiential memory to guide future planning cycles. We demonstrate through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world that our T-A-L agent significantly outperforms baseline methods, including open-loop LLMs, Behavioral Cloning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning. Our framework achieves over a 97% success rate on complex, long-horizon tasks, converges to a stable policy in an average of just 9 trials, and exhibits remarkable generalization to unseen tasks. This work presents a significant step towards developing more robust, adaptive, and truly autonomous robotic agents.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

| **[How Robot Dogs See the Unseeable: Improving Visual Interpretability via Peering for Exploratory Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16262v2)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Occlusion from obstacles, such as foliage, can severely obstruct a robot's sensors, impairing scene understanding. We show that "peering", a characteristic side-to-side movement used by insects to overcome their visual limitations, can also allow robots to markedly improve visual reasoning under partial occlusion. This is accomplished by applying core signal processing principles, specifically optical synthetic aperture sensing, together with the vision reasoning capabilities of modern large multimodal models. Peering enables real-time, high-resolution, and wavelength-independent perception, which is crucial for vision-based scene understanding across a wide range of applications. The approach is low-cost and immediately deployable on any camera-equipped robot. We investigated different peering motions and occlusion masking strategies, demonstrating that, unlike peering, state-of-the-art multi-view 3D vision techniques fail in these conditions due to their high susceptibility to occlusion. Robots that see through occlusion will gain superior perception abilities - including enhanced scene understanding, situational awareness, camouflage breaking, and advanced navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural Induced Exploration for Balanced and Scalable Multi-Robot Path Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21654v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot path planning is a fundamental yet challenging problem due to its combinatorial complexity and the need to balance global efficiency with fair task allocation among robots. Traditional swarm intelligence methods, although effective on small instances, often converge prematurely and struggle to scale to complex environments. In this work, we present a structure-induced exploration framework that integrates structural priors into the search process of the ant colony optimization (ACO). The approach leverages the spatial distribution of the task to induce a structural prior at initialization, thereby constraining the search space. The pheromone update rule is then designed to emphasize structurally meaningful connections and incorporates a load-aware objective to reconcile the total travel distance with individual robot workload. An explicit overlap suppression strategy further ensures that tasks remain distinct and balanced across the team. The proposed framework was validated on diverse benchmark scenarios covering a wide range of instance sizes and robot team configurations. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in route compactness, stability, and workload distribution compared to representative metaheuristic baselines. Beyond performance gains, the method also provides a scalable and interpretable framework that can be readily applied to logistics, surveillance, and search-and-rescue applications where reliable large-scale coordination is essential.</p></details> | 20pages, 6Figues |
| **[UniTacHand: Unified Spatio-Tactile Representation for Human to Robotic Hand Skill Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21233v2)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tactile sensing is crucial for robotic hands to achieve human-level dexterous manipulation, especially in scenarios with visual occlusion. However, its application is often hindered by the difficulty of collecting large-scale real-world robotic tactile data. In this study, we propose to collect low-cost human manipulation data using haptic gloves for tactile-based robotic policy learning. The misalignment between human and robotic tactile data makes it challenging to transfer policies learned from human data to robots. To bridge this gap, we propose UniTacHand, a unified representation to align robotic tactile information captured by dexterous hands with human hand touch obtained from gloves. First, we project tactile signals from both human hands and robotic hands onto a morphologically consistent 2D surface space of the MANO hand model. This unification standardizes the heterogeneous data structures and inherently embeds the tactile signals with spatial context. Then, we introduce a contrastive learning method to align them into a unified latent space, trained on only 10 minutes of paired data from our data collection system. Our approach enables zero-shot tactile-based policy transfer from humans to a real robot, generalizing to objects unseen in the pre-training data. We also demonstrate that co-training on mixed data, including both human and robotic demonstrations via UniTacHand, yields better performance and data efficiency compared with using only robotic data. UniTacHand paves a path toward general, scalable, and data-efficient learning for tactile-based dexterous hands.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Robotic Variable Stiffness Mechanism Based on Helically Wound Structured Electrostatic Layer Jamming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21534v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel variable stiffness mechanism termed Helically Wound Structured Electrostatic Layer Jamming (HWS-ELJ) and systematically investigates its potential applications in variable stiffness robotic finger design. The proposed method utilizes electrostatic attraction to enhance interlayer friction, thereby suppressing relative sliding and enabling tunable stiffness. Compared with conventional planar ELJ, the helical configuration of HWS-ELJ provides exponentially increasing stiffness adjustment with winding angle, achieving significantly greater stiffness enhancement for the same electrode contact area while reducing the required footprint under equivalent stiffness conditions. Considering the practical advantage of voltage-based control, a series of experimental tests under different initial force conditions were conducted to evaluate the stiffness modulation characteristics of HWS-ELJ. The results demonstrated its rational design and efficacy, with outcomes following the deduced theoretical trends. Furthermore, a robotic finger prototype integrating HWS-ELJ was developed, demonstrating voltage-driven stiffness modulation and confirming the feasibility of the proposed robotic variable stiffness mechanism.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, this paper proposes a self-propelled pipeline robot design based on force analysis and dynamic simulation, with a specific focus on solving core challenges including vertical climbing failure and poor passability in T-branch pipes. Adopting a wheeled configuration and modular design, the robot prioritizes the core demand of body motion control. Specifically, 3D modeling of the robot was first completed using SolidWorks. Subsequently, the model was imported into ADAMS for dynamic simulation, which provided a basis for optimizing the drive module and motion control strategy.To verify the robot's dynamic performance, an experimental platform with acrylic pipes was constructed. Through adjusting its body posture to surmount obstacles and select directions, the robot has demonstrated its ability to stably traverse various complex pipeline scenarios.

However, when faced with complex and curved pipeline scenarios, these methods often fail due to problems such as cable entanglement and insufficient equipment flexibility. To address this pain point, we designed a self-propelled pipeline robot. This robot can autonomously complete the location work of complex and curved pipelines in complex pipe networks without external dragging. In terms of pipeline mapping technology, traditional visual mapping and laser mapping methods are easily affected by lighting conditions and insufficient features in the confined space of pipelines, resulting in mapping drift and divergence problems. In contrast, the pipeline location method that integrates inertial navigation and wheel odometers is less affected by pipeline environmental factors. Based on this, this paper proposes a pipeline robot location method based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF). Firstly, the body attitude angle is initially obtained through an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Then, the extended Kalman filtering algorithm is used to improve the accuracy of attitude angle estimation. Finally, high-precision pipeline location is achieved by combining wheel odometers. During the testing phase, the roll wheels of the pipeline robot needed to fit tightly against the pipe wall to reduce slippage. However, excessive tightness would reduce the flexibility of motion control due to excessive friction. Therefore, a balance needed to be struck between the robot's motion capability and positioning accuracy. Experiments were conducted using the self-propelled pipeline robot in a rectangular loop pipeline, and the results verified the effectiveness of the proposed dead reckoning algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper needs further revision</p></details> |

To address this, this paper presents a novel control framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable intuitive, natural language-based navigation. We propose a distributed architecture where high-level instruction processing is offloaded to an external server to overcome the onboard computational constraints of the DeepRobotics Jueying Lite 3 platform. The system grounds LLM-generated plans into executable ROS navigation commands using real-time sensor fusion (LiDAR, IMU, and Odometry). Experimental validation was conducted in a structured indoor environment across four distinct scenarios, ranging from single-room tasks to complex cross-zone navigation. The results demonstrate the system's robustness, achieving an aggregate success rate of over 90\% across all scenarios, validating the feasibility of offloaded LLM-based planning for autonomous quadruped deployment in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

Traditional tethered sensor configurations often restrict joint movement and introduce mechanical noises. This study proposes a wireless embedded balance system designed to maintain stability on uneven surfaces. The system utilizes a custom-designed foot unit integrated with four load cells and an ESP32-C3 microcontroller to estimate the Center of Pressure (CoP) in real time. The CoP data were transmitted wirelessly to the main controller to minimize the wiring complexity of the 29-DoF VI-ROSE humanoid robot. A PID control strategy is implemented to adjust the torso, hip, and ankle roll joints based on CoP feedback. Experimental characterization demonstrated high sensor precision with an average measurement error of 14.8 g. Furthermore, the proposed control system achieved a 100% success rate in maintaining balance during single-leg lifting tasks at a 3-degree inclination with optimized PID parameters (Kp=0.10, Kd=0.005). These results validate the efficacy of wireless CoP feedback in enhancing the postural stability of humanoid robots, without compromising their mechanical flexibility.</p></details> |  |

Recent researches have increasingly explored language-guided manipulation, where robots not only perceive the scene but also interpret task-relevant natural language instructions. However, existing language-conditioned grasping methods typically rely on shallow fusion strategies, leading to limited semantic grounding and weak alignment between linguistic intent and visual grasp reasoning.In this work, we propose Language-Guided Grasp Detection (LGGD) with a coarse-to-fine learning paradigm for robotic manipulation. LGGD leverages CLIP-based visual and textual embeddings within a hierarchical cross-modal fusion pipeline, progressively injecting linguistic cues into the visual feature reconstruction process. This design enables fine-grained visual-semantic alignment and improves the feasibility of the predicted grasps with respect to task instructions. In addition, we introduce a language-conditioned dynamic convolution head (LDCH) that mixes multiple convolution experts based on sentence-level features, enabling instruction-adaptive coarse mask and grasp predictions. A final refinement module further enhances grasp consistency and robustness in complex scenes.Experiments on the OCID-VLG and Grasp-Anything++ datasets show that LGGD surpasses existing language-guided grasping methods, exhibiting strong generalization to unseen objects and diverse language queries. Moreover, deployment on a real robotic platform demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach in executing accurate, instruction-conditioned grasp actions. The code will be released publicly upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Journal</p></details> |
| **[RGMP: Recurrent Geometric-prior Multimodal Policy for Generalizable Humanoid Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09141v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots exhibit significant potential in executing diverse human-level skills. However, current research predominantly relies on data-driven approaches that necessitate extensive training datasets to achieve robust multimodal decision-making capabilities and generalizable visuomotor control. These methods raise concerns due to the neglect of geometric reasoning in unseen scenarios and the inefficient modeling of robot-target relationships within the training data, resulting in significant waste of training resources. To address these limitations, we present the Recurrent Geometric-prior Multimodal Policy (RGMP), an end-to-end framework that unifies geometric-semantic skill reasoning with data-efficient visuomotor control. For perception capabilities, we propose the Geometric-prior Skill Selector, which infuses geometric inductive biases into a vision language model, producing adaptive skill sequences for unseen scenes with minimal spatial common sense tuning. To achieve data-efficient robotic motion synthesis, we introduce the Adaptive Recursive Gaussian Network, which parameterizes robot-object interactions as a compact hierarchy of Gaussian processes that recursively encode multi-scale spatial relationships, yielding dexterous, data-efficient motion synthesis even from sparse demonstrations. Evaluated on both our humanoid robot and desktop dual-arm robot, the RGMP framework achieves 87% task success in generalization tests and exhibits 5x greater data efficiency than the state-of-the-art model. This performance underscores its superior cross-domain generalization, enabled by geometric-semantic reasoning and recursive-Gaussion adaptation.</p></details> |  |

While human responses to these queries make it possible to learn policies aligned with human preferences, PbRL suffers from low query efficiency, as policy bias limits trajectory diversity and reduces the number of discriminable queries available for learning preferences. This paper identifies preference discriminability, which quantifies how easily a human can judge which trajectory is closer to their ideal behavior, as a key metric for improving query efficiency. To address this, we move beyond comparisons within a single policy and instead generate queries by comparing trajectories from multiple policies, as training them from scratch promotes diversity without policy bias. We propose Discriminability-Aware Policy-to-Policy Preference-Based Efficient Reinforcement Learning (DAPPER), which integrates preference discriminability with trajectory diversification achieved by multiple policies. DAPPER trains new policies from scratch after each reward update and employs a discriminator that learns to estimate preference discriminability, enabling the prioritized sampling of more discriminable queries. During training, it jointly maximizes the preference reward and preference discriminability score, encouraging the discovery of highly rewarding and easily distinguishable policies. Experiments in simulated and real-world legged robot environments demonstrate that DAPPER outperforms previous methods in query efficiency, particularly under challenging preference discriminability conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine (RAM)</p></details> |

We conducted two comprehensive experiments (N = 1,038) examining how occupational contexts and stereotype activation shape robotic agent choices across construction, healthcare, educational, and athletic domains. Participants made selections from artificial agents that varied systematically in skin tone and anthropomorphic characteristics. Our study revealed distinct context-dependent patterns. Healthcare and educational scenarios demonstrated strong favoritism toward lighter-skinned artificial agents, while construction and athletic contexts showed greater acceptance of darker-toned alternatives. Participant race was associated with systematic differences in selection patterns across professional domains. The second experiment demonstrated that exposure to human professionals from specific racial backgrounds systematically shifted later robotic agent preferences in stereotype-consistent directions. These findings show that occupational biases and color-based discrimination transfer directly from human-human to human-robot evaluation contexts.

| **[Imperative Learning: A Self-supervised Neuro-Symbolic Learning Framework for Robot Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16087v8)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven methods such as reinforcement and imitation learning have achieved remarkable success in robot autonomy. However, their data-centric nature still hinders them from generalizing well to ever-changing environments. Moreover, labeling data for robotic tasks is often impractical and expensive. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new self-supervised neuro-symbolic (NeSy) computational framework, imperative learning (IL), for robot autonomy, leveraging the generalization abilities of symbolic reasoning. The framework of IL consists of three primary components: a neural module, a reasoning engine, and a memory system. We formulate IL as a special bilevel optimization (BLO), which enables reciprocal learning over the three modules. This overcomes the label-intensive obstacles associated with data-driven approaches and takes advantage of symbolic reasoning concerning logical reasoning, physical principles, geometric analysis, etc. We discuss several optimization techniques for IL and verify their effectiveness in five distinct robot autonomy tasks including path planning, rule induction, optimal control, visual odometry, and multi-robot routing. Through various experiments, we show that IL can significantly enhance robot autonomy capabilities and we anticipate that it will catalyze further research across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |

However, due to mechanical differences between human and robot hands, completely reproducing human motions on robot hands is impossible. Existing works on retargeting incorporate various optimization objectives, focusing on different aspects of hand configuration. However, the lack of experimental comparative studies leaves the significance and effectiveness of these objectives unclear. This work aims to analyze these retargeting objectives for dexterous manipulation through extensive real-world comparative experiments. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive retargeting objective formulation that integrates intuitively crucial factors appearing in recent approaches. The significance of each factor is evaluated through experimental ablation studies on the full objective in kinematic posture retargeting and real-world teleoperated manipulation tasks. Experimental results and conclusions provide valuable insights for designing more accurate and effective retargeting algorithms for real-world dexterous manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: E...</summary><p>v2: Extended the main text with additional analysis and implementation details</p></details> |
| **[Proprioception Enhances Vision Language Model in Generating Captions and Subtask Segmentations for Robot Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20876v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From the perspective of future developments in robotics, it is crucial to verify whether foundation models trained exclusively on offline data, such as images and language, can understand the robot motion. In particular, since Vision Language Models (VLMs) do not include low-level motion information from robots in their training datasets, video understanding including trajectory information remains a significant challenge. In this study, we assess two capabilities of VLMs through a video captioning task with low-level robot motion information: (1) automatic captioning of robot tasks and (2) segmentation of a series of tasks. Both capabilities are expected to enhance the efficiency of robot imitation learning by linking language and motion and serve as a measure of the foundation model's performance. The proposed method generates multiple "scene" captions using image captions and trajectory data from robot tasks. The full task caption is then generated by summarizing these individual captions. Additionally, the method performs subtask segmentation by comparing the similarity between text embeddings of image captions. In both captioning tasks, the proposed method aims to improve performance by providing the robot's motion data - joint and end-effector states - as input to the VLM. Simulator experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a modular design framework that selects the forward velocity to decouple the radial coordinate, allowing the steering subsystem to be stabilized independently. Within this structure, we develop families of feedback laws using passivity, backstepping, and integrator forwarding. Each law is accompanied by a strict control Lyapunov function, including barrier variants that enforce angular constraints. These strict CLFs provide constructive class KL convergence estimates and enable eigenvalue assignment at the target equilibrium. The framework generalizes and extends prior modular and nonmodular approaches, while preparing the ground for inverse optimal and adaptive redesigns in the sequel paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2509.25575</p></details> |

The dataset aims to bridge a gap in human-robot collaboration research, providing insights into the impact of object weight in human handovers and readiness cues for intuitive robotic motion planning. The underlying dataset for object recognition and tracking is the YCB (Yale-CMU-Berkeley) dataset, which is an established standard dataset used in algorithms for robotic manipulation, including grasping and carrying objects. The YCB-Handovers dataset incorporates human motion patterns in handovers, making it applicable for data-driven, human-inspired models aimed at weight-sensitive motion planning and adaptive robotic behaviors. This dataset covers an extensive range of weights, allowing for a more robust study of handover behavior and weight variation. Some objects also require careful handovers, highlighting contrasts with standard handovers. We also provide a detailed analysis of the object's weight impact on the human reaching motion in these handovers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper presented at the IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN), 2025</p></details> |

The approach relies solely on a monocular camera with fiducials for target tracking and operates entirely in the local observer frame without the need for global information. The core contribution of this work is a streamlined and general approach to autonomous interception that can be adapted across robots with varying dynamics, as well as our comprehensive study of the robot interception problem across heterogenous mobility systems under limited observability and no global localization. Our method integrates (1) an Extended Kalman Filter for relative pose estimation amid intermittent measurements, (2) a history-conditioned motion predictor for dynamic target trajectory propagation, and (3) a receding-horizon planner solving a constrained convex program in real time to ensure time-efficient and kinematically feasible interception paths. Our operating regime assumes that observability is restricted by partial fields of view, sensor dropouts, and target occlusions. Experiments are performed in these conditions and include autonomous UAV landing on dynamic targets, rover rendezvous and leader-follower tasks, and spacecraft proximity operations. Results from simulated and physical experiments demonstrate robust performance with low interception errors (both during station-keeping and upon scenario completion), high success rates under deterministic and stochastic target motion profiles, and real-time execution on embedded processors such as the Jetson Orin, VOXL2, and Raspberry Pi 5. These results highlight the framework's generalizability, robustness, and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) for Communicationless Cooperative Collision Avoidance in Robot Swarms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20391v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cooperative collision avoidance between robots in swarm operations remains an open challenge. Assuming a decentralized architecture, each robot is responsible for making its own control decisions, including motion planning. To this end, most existing approaches mostly rely some form of (wireless) communication between the agents of the swarm. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, transmission faults, and is subject to adversarial attacks, such as jamming or spoofing. This paper proposes Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) as a communicationless alternative. It follows the implicit cooperation paradigm, under which the design of the robots is based on consensual (offline) rules, similar to traffic rules. They include the definition of a contingency trajectory for each robot, and a method for construction of mutual collision avoidance constraints. The setup is shown to guarantee the recursive feasibility and collision avoidance between all swarm members in closed-loop operation. Moreover, CMC naturally satisfies the Plug \& Play paradigm, i.e., for new robots entering the swarm. Two numerical examples demonstrate that the collision avoidance guarantee is intact and that the robot swarm operates smoothly under the CMC regime.</p></details> |  |

We proposed an articulated robots consisting of multiple pneumatic bladder links connected by rolling contact joints called Hillberry joints. The bladder link is made of a double-layered structure of tarpaulin sheet and polyurethane sheet, which is both airtight and flexible in shape. The integration of the Hilberry joint into an inflatable robot is also a new approach. The rolling contact joint allows wide range of motion of $\pm 150 ^{\circ}$, the largest among the conventional inflatable joints. Using the proposed mechanism for inflatable robots, we demonstrated moving a 500 g payload with a 3-DoF arm and lifting 3.4 kg and 5 kg payloads with 2-DoF and 1-DoF arms, respectively. We also experimented with a single 3-DoF inflatable leg attached to a dolly to show that the proposed structure worked for legged locomotion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS2024 (IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Stack-of-Tasks Management for Redundant Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10780v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel framework for automatically learning complete Stack-of-Tasks (SoT) controllers for redundant robotic systems, including task priorities, activation logic, and control parameters. Unlike classical SoT pipelines-where task hierarchies are manually defined and tuned-our approach optimizes the full SoT structure directly from a user-specified cost function encoding intuitive preferences such as safety, precision, manipulability, or execution speed. The method combines Genetic Programming with simulation-based evaluation to explore both discrete (priority order, task activation) and continuous (gains, trajectory durations) components of the controller. We validate the framework on a dual-arm mobile manipulator (the ABB mobile-YuMi research platform), demonstrating robust convergence across multiple cost definitions, automatic suppression of irrelevant tasks, and strong resilience to distractors. Learned SoTs exhibit expert-like hierarchical structure and adapt naturally to multi-objective trade-offs. Crucially, all controllers transfer from Gazebo simulation to the real robot, achieving safe and precise motion without additional tuning. Experiments in static and dynamic environments show reliable obstacle avoidance, high tracking accuracy, and predictable behavior in the presence of humans. The proposed method provides an interpretable and scalable alternative to manual SoT design, enabling rapid, user-driven generation of task execution hierarchies for complex robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite-Time Control Based on Differential Flatness for Wheeled Mobile Robots with Experimental Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20229v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A robust tracking control strategy is designed to empower wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) to track predetermined routes while operating in diverse fields and encountering disturbances like strong winds or uneven path conditions, which affect tracking performance. Ensuring the applicability of this tracking method in real-world scenarios is essential. To accomplish this, the WMR model is initially transformed into a linear canonical form by leveraging the differential flatness of its kinematic model, facilitating controller design. Subsequently, a novel integral nonlinear hyperplane-based sliding mode control (INH-SMC) technique is proposed for WMR under disturbances. The stability of the technique is analyzed and verified. Finally, its practical viability is demonstrated through a comparative real-world indoor experiment on a TurtleBot3 WMR subjected to disturbances, confirming the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous Fast-Slow Vision-Language-Action Policies for Whole-Body Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20188v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for semantic reasoning with an action expert generating continuous action signals, yet both typically run at a single unified frequency. As a result, policy performance is constrained by the low inference speed of large VLMs. This mandatory synchronous execution severely limits control stability and real-time performance in whole-body robotic manipulation, which involves more joints, larger motion spaces, and dynamically changing views. We introduce a truly asynchronous Fast-Slow VLA framework (DuoCore-FS), organizing the system into a fast pathway for high-frequency action generation and a slow pathway for rich VLM reasoning. The system is characterized by two key features. First, a latent representation buffer bridges the slow and fast systems. It stores instruction semantics and action-reasoning representation aligned with the scene-instruction context, providing high-level guidance to the fast pathway. Second, a whole-body action tokenizer provides a compact, unified representation of whole-body actions. Importantly, the VLM and action expert are still jointly trained end-to-end, preserving unified policy learning while enabling asynchronous execution. DuoCore-FS supports a 3B-parameter VLM while achieving 30 Hz whole-body action-chunk generation, approximately three times as fast as prior VLA models with comparable model sizes. Real-world whole-body manipulation experiments demonstrate improved task success rates and significantly enhanced responsiveness compared to synchronous Fast-Slow VLA baselines. The implementation of DuoCore-FS, including training, inference, and deployment, is provided to commercial users by Astribot as part of the Astribot robotic platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoLA: Long Horizon Latent Action Learning for General Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20166v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capability of performing long-horizon, language-guided robotic manipulation tasks critically relies on leveraging historical information and generating coherent action sequences. However, such capabilities are often overlooked by existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. To solve this challenge, we propose LoLA (Long Horizon Latent Action Learning), a framework designed for robot manipulation that integrates long-term multi-view observations and robot proprioception to enable multi-step reasoning and action generation. We first employ Vision-Language Models to encode rich contextual features from historical sequences and multi-view observations. We further introduces a key module, State-Aware Latent Re-representation, which transforms visual inputs and language commands into actionable robot motion space. Unlike existing VLA approaches that merely concatenate robot proprioception (e.g., joint angles) with VL embeddings, this module leverages such robot states to explicitly ground VL representations in physical scale through a learnable "embodiment-anchored" latent space. We trained LoLA on diverse robotic pre-training datasets and conducted extensive evaluations on simulation benchmarks (SIMPLER and LIBERO), as well as two real-world tasks on Franka and Bi-Manual Aloha robots. Results show that LoLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods (e.g., pi0), particularly in long-horizon manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

We propose a new RL framework with ReflexNet for low-level task execution, SchemaPlanner for symbolic reasoning, and HyperOptima for long-term context modeling, ensuring continuous adaptation and memory retention. Experimental results show that DRAE significantly outperforms baseline approaches in long-term task retention and knowledge reuse, achieving an average task success rate of 82.5% across a set of dynamic robotic manipulation tasks, compared to 74.2% for traditional MoE models. Furthermore, DRAE maintains an extremely low forgetting rate, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in catastrophic forgetting mitigation. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling flexible, scalable, and efficient lifelong learning for robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the main conference of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025)</p></details> |
| **[GR-RL: Going Dexterous and Precise for Long-Horizon Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01801v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GR-RL, a robotic learning framework that turns a generalist vision-language-action (VLA) policy into a highly capable specialist for long-horizon dexterous manipulation. Assuming the optimality of human demonstrations is core to existing VLA policies. However, we claim that in highly dexterous and precise manipulation tasks, human demonstrations are noisy and suboptimal. GR-RL proposes a multi-stage training pipeline that filters, augments, and reinforces the demonstrations by reinforcement learning. First, GR-RL learns a vision-language-conditioned task progress, filters the demonstration trajectories, and only keeps the transitions that contribute positively to the progress. Specifically, we show that by directly applying offline RL with sparse reward, the resulting $Q$-values can be treated as a robust progress function. Next, we introduce morphological symmetry augmentation that greatly improves the generalization and performance of GR-RL. Lastly, to better align the VLA policy with its deployment behaviors for high-precision control, we perform online RL by learning a latent space noise predictor. With this pipeline, GR-RL is, to our knowledge, the first learning-based policy that can autonomously lace up a shoe by threading shoelaces through multiple eyelets with an 83.3% success rate, a task requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and compliant soft-body interaction. We hope GR-RL provides a step toward enabling generalist robot foundation models to specialize into reliable real-world experts.</p></details> |  |

However, a key challenge lies in their ability to generalize beyond the specific environments and conditions they were trained on, which is presently difficult and expensive to evaluate in the real-world. To address this gap, we present REALM, a new simulation environment and benchmark designed to evaluate the generalization capabilities of VLA models, with a specific emphasis on establishing a strong correlation between simulated and real-world performance through high-fidelity visuals and aligned robot control. Our environment offers a suite of 15 perturbation factors, 7 manipulation skills, and more than 3,500 objects. Finally, we establish two task sets that form our benchmark and evaluate the π_{0}, π_{0}-FAST, and GR00T N1.5 VLA models, showing that generalization and robustness remain an open challenge. More broadly, we also show that simulation gives us a valuable proxy for the real-world and allows us to systematically probe for and quantify the weaknesses and failure modes of VLAs.

Companion robots offer a potential solution. However, current companion robots often lack advanced functionality, while task-oriented robots are not designed for social interaction, limiting their suitability and acceptance by seniors. Our work introduces a senior-oriented system for quadruped robots that allows for more intuitive user input and provides more socially expressive output. For user input, we implemented a MediaPipe-based module for hand gesture and head movement recognition, enabling control without a remote. For output, we designed and trained robotic dog gestures using curriculum-based reinforcement learning in Isaac Gym, progressing from simple standing to three-legged balancing and leg extensions, and more. The final tests achieved over 95\% success on average in simulation, and we validated a key social gesture (the paw-lift) on a Unitree robot. Real-world tests demonstrated the feasibility and social expressiveness of this framework, while also revealing sim-to-real challenges in joint compliance, load distribution, and balance control. These contributions advance the development of practical quadruped robots as social companions for the senior and outline pathways for sim-to-real adaptation and inform future user studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation (ACRA) 2025</p></details> |

To reduce repetitive data collection, we present Real2Edit2Real, a framework that generates new demonstrations by bridging 3D editability with 2D visual data through a 3D control interface. Our approach first reconstructs scene geometry from multi-view RGB observations with a metric-scale 3D reconstruction model. Based on the reconstructed geometry, we perform depth-reliable 3D editing on point clouds to generate new manipulation trajectories while geometrically correcting the robot poses to recover physically consistent depth, which serves as a reliable condition for synthesizing new demonstrations. Finally, we propose a multi-conditional video generation model guided by depth as the primary control signal, together with action, edge, and ray maps, to synthesize spatially augmented multi-view manipulation videos. Experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that policies trained on data generated from only 1-5 source demonstrations can match or outperform those trained on 50 real-world demonstrations, improving data efficiency by up to 10-50x. Moreover, experimental results on height and texture editing demonstrate the framework's flexibility and extensibility, indicating its potential to serve as a unified data generation framework.</p></details> |  |

This requires robots to perceive and reason over the current task scene through multiple modalities, and to plan their behaviors to achieve their intended goals. Traditional robotic task-planning approaches often struggle to bridge low-level execution with high-level task reasoning, and cannot dynamically update task strategies when instructions change during execution, which ultimately limits their versatility and adaptability to new tasks. In this work, we propose a novel language model-based framework for dynamic robot task planning. Our Vision-Language-Policy (VLP) model, based on a vision-language model fine-tuned on real-world data, can interpret semantic instructions and integrate reasoning over the current task scene to generate behavior policies that control the robot to accomplish the task. Moreover, it can dynamically adjust the task strategy in response to changes in the task, enabling flexible adaptation to evolving task requirements. Experiments conducted with different robots and a variety of real-world tasks show that the trained model can efficiently adapt to novel scenarios and dynamically update its policy, demonstrating strong planning autonomy and cross-embodiment generalization.

Variable stiffness actuators are well suited for such applications. However, in most existing designs, stiffness is coupled with the deflection angle, complicating both modeling and control. To address this limitation, this paper presents a variable stiffness actuator featuring decoupled stiffness and output behavior for rehabilitation robotics. The system integrates a variable stiffness mechanism that combines a variable-length lever with a hypocycloidal straight-line mechanism to achieve a linear torque-deflection relationship and continuous stiffness modulation from near zero to theoretically infinite. It also incorporates a differential transmission mechanism based on a planetary gear system that enables dual-motor load sharing. A cascade PI controller is further developed on the basis of the differential configuration, in which the position-loop term jointly regulates stiffness and deflection angle, effectively suppressing stiffness fluctuations and output disturbances. The performance of prototype was experimentally validated through stiffness calibration, stiffness regulation, torque control, decoupled characteristics, and dual-motor load sharing, indicating the potential for rehabilitation exoskeletons and other pHRI systems.</p></details> |  |

Given a history of egocentric RGB frames, contact maps, actions, and joint states, ChronoDreamer predicts future video frames, contact distributions, and joint angles via a spatial-temporal transformer trained with MaskGIT-style masked prediction. Contact is encoded as depth-weighted Gaussian splat images that render 3D forces into a camera-aligned format suitable for vision backbones. At inference, predicted rollouts are evaluated by a vision-language model that reasons about collision likelihood, enabling rejection sampling of unsafe actions before execution. We train and evaluate on DreamerBench, a simulation dataset generated with Project Chrono that provides synchronized RGB, contact splat, proprioception, and physics annotations across rigid and deformable object scenarios. Qualitative results demonstrate that the model preserves spatial coherence during non-contact motion and generates plausible contact predictions, while the LLM-based judge distinguishes collision from non-collision trajectories.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that rely on abstract latent dynamics or delegate reasoning to language components, STORM grounds planning in explicit visual rollouts, enabling interpretable and foresight-driven decision-making. A diffusion-based VLA policy proposes diverse candidate actions, a generative video world model simulates their visual and reward outcomes, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) selectively refines plans through lookahead evaluation. Experiments on the SimplerEnv manipulation benchmark demonstrate that STORM achieves a new state-of-the-art average success rate of 51.0 percent, outperforming strong baselines such as CogACT. Reward-augmented video prediction substantially improves spatio-temporal fidelity and task relevance, reducing Frechet Video Distance by over 75 percent.

We present the Empathic Ethical Disobedience (EED) Gym, a standardized testbed that jointly evaluates refusal safety and social acceptability. Agents weigh risk, affect, and trust when choosing to comply, refuse (with or without explanation), clarify, or propose safer alternatives. EED Gym provides different scenarios, multiple persona profiles, and metrics for safety, calibration, and refusals, with trust and blame models grounded in a vignette study. Using EED Gym, we find that action masking eliminates unsafe compliance, while explanatory refusals help sustain trust. Constructive styles are rated most trustworthy, empathic styles -- most empathic, and safe RL methods improve robustness but also make agents more prone to overly cautious behavior. We release code, configurations, and reference policies to enable reproducible evaluation and systematic human-robot interaction research on refusal and trust. At submission time, we include an anonymized reproducibility package with code and configs, and we commit to open-sourcing the full repository after the paper is accepted.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI 2026).

Recent advances in the field demand simulation frameworks that combine physical accuracy, computational scalability, and seamless integration with modern control and optimization pipelines. In this work, we present Py-DiSMech, a Python-based, open-source simulation framework for modeling and control of soft robotic structures grounded in the principles of Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG). By discretizing geometric quantities such as curvature and strain directly on meshes, Py-DiSMech captures the nonlinear deformation of rods, shells, and hybrid structures with high fidelity and reduced computational cost. The framework introduces (i) a fully vectorized NumPy implementation achieving order-of-magnitude speed-ups over existing geometry-based simulators; (ii) a penalty-energy-based fully implicit contact model that supports rod-rod, rod-shell, and shell-shell interactions; (iii) a natural-strain-based feedback-control module featuring a proportional-integral (PI) controller for shape regulation and trajectory tracking; and (iv) a modular, object-oriented software design enabling user-defined elastic energies, actuation schemes, and integration with machine-learning libraries. Benchmark comparisons demonstrate that Py-DiSMech substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art simulator Elastica in computational efficiency while maintaining physical accuracy. Together, these features establish Py-DiSMech as a scalable, extensible platform for simulation-driven design, control validation, and sim-to-real research in soft robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Softw...</summary><p>Software: https://github.com/structuresComp/dismech-python Supplementary Video: https://youtu.be/AfFcoAZR0Go</p></details> |
| **[Learning Semantic Atomic Skills for Multi-Task Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18368v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While imitation learning has shown impressive results in single-task robot manipulation, scaling it to multi-task settings remains a fundamental challenge due to issues such as suboptimal demonstrations, trajectory noise, and behavioral multi-modality. Existing skill-based methods attempt to address this by decomposing actions into reusable abstractions, but they often rely on fixed-length segmentation or environmental priors that limit semantic consistency and cross-task generalization. In this work, we propose AtomSkill, a novel multi-task imitation learning framework that learns and leverages a structured Atomic Skill Space for composable robot manipulation. Our approach is built on two key technical contributions. First, we construct a Semantically Grounded Atomic Skill Library by partitioning demonstrations into variable-length skills using gripper-state keyframe detection and vision-language model annotation. A contrastive learning objective ensures the resulting skill embeddings are both semantically consistent and temporally coherent. Second, we propose an Action Generation module with Keypose Imagination, which jointly predicts a skill's long-horizon terminal keypose and its immediate action sequence. This enables the policy to reason about overarching motion goals and fine-grained control simultaneously, facilitating robust skill chaining. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments show that AtomSkill consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iterative Compositional Data Generation for Robot Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10891v3)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting robotic manipulation data is expensive, making it impractical to acquire demonstrations for the combinatorially large space of tasks that arise in multi-object, multi-robot, and multi-environment settings. While recent generative models can synthesize useful data for individual tasks, they do not exploit the compositional structure of robotic domains and struggle to generalize to unseen task combinations. We propose a semantic compositional diffusion transformer that factorizes transitions into robot-, object-, obstacle-, and objective-specific components and learns their interactions through attention. Once trained on a limited subset of tasks, we show that our model can zero-shot generate high-quality transitions from which we can learn control policies for unseen task combinations. Then, we introduce an iterative self-improvement procedure in which synthetic data is validated via offline reinforcement learning and incorporated into subsequent training rounds. Our approach substantially improves zero-shot performance over monolithic and hard-coded compositional baselines, ultimately solving nearly all held-out tasks and demonstrating the emergence of meaningful compositional structure in the learned representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added experiments in Appendix A; no change to main paper</p></details> |

To fully unlock the potential of IL for surgery, access to clinical datasets is needed, which unfortunately lack the kinematic data required for current IL approaches. A promising source of large-scale surgical demonstrations is monocular surgical videos available online, making monocular pose estimation a crucial step toward enabling large-scale robot learning. Toward this end, we propose SurgiPose, a differentiable rendering based approach to estimate kinematic information from monocular surgical videos, eliminating the need for direct access to ground truth kinematics. Our method infers tool trajectories and joint angles by optimizing tool pose parameters to minimize the discrepancy between rendered and real images. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on two robotic surgical tasks: tissue lifting and needle pickup, using the da Vinci Research Kit Si (dVRK Si). We train imitation learning policies with both ground truth measured kinematics and estimated kinematics from video and compare their performance. Our results show that policies trained on estimated kinematics achieve comparable success rates to those trained on ground truth data, demonstrating the feasibility of using monocular video based kinematic estimation for surgical robot learning. By enabling kinematic estimation from monocular surgical videos, our work lays the foundation for large scale learning of autonomous surgical policies from online surgical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping (BiPS), which transforms question-conditioned masked views into bidirectional where-to-look signals that shape perception during training. BiPS first applies a KL-consistency constraint between the original image and an evidence-preserving view that keeps only question-relevant regions, encouraging coarse but complete coverage of supporting pixels. It then applies a KL-separation constraint between the original and an evidence-ablated view where critical pixels are masked so the image no longer supports the original answer, discouraging text-only shortcuts (i.e., answering from text alone) and enforcing fine-grained visual reliance. Across eight benchmarks, BiPS boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.2% on average and shows strong out-of-domain generalization to unseen datasets and image types.</p></details> |  |

An Adversarial Parametric Editing Framework for Hallucination Mitigation in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21999v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered increasing attention in the AI community due to their promising practical applications, they exhibit persistent hallucination issues, generating outputs misaligned with visual inputs. Recent studies attribute these hallucinations to VLMs' over-reliance on linguistic priors and insufficient visual feature integration, proposing heuristic decoding calibration strategies to mitigate them. However, the non-trainable nature of these strategies inherently limits their optimization potential. To this end, we propose an adversarial parametric editing framework for Hallucination mitigation in VLMs, which follows an \textbf{A}ctivate-\textbf{L}ocate-\textbf{E}dit \textbf{A}dversarially paradigm. Specifically, we first construct an activation dataset that comprises grounded responses (positive samples attentively anchored in visual features) and hallucinatory responses (negative samples reflecting LLM prior bias and internal knowledge artifacts). Next, we identify critical hallucination-prone parameter clusters by analyzing differential hidden states of response pairs. Then, these clusters are fine-tuned using prompts injected with adversarial tuned prefixes that are optimized to maximize visual neglect, thereby forcing the model to prioritize visual evidence over inherent parametric biases. Evaluations on both generative and discriminative VLM tasks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of ALEAHallu in alleviating hallucinations. Our code is available at https://github.com/hujiayu1223/ALEAHallu.</p></details> |  |
| **[LVLM-Aided Alignment of Task-Specific Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21985v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In high-stakes domains, small task-specific vision models are crucial due to their low computational requirements and the availability of numerous methods to explain their results. However, these explanations often reveal that the models do not align well with human domain knowledge, relying instead on spurious correlations. This might result in brittle behavior once deployed in the real-world. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and efficient method for aligning small task-specific vision models with human domain knowledge by leveraging the generalization capabilities of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM). Our LVLM-Aided Visual Alignment (LVLM-VA) method provides a bidirectional interface that translates model behavior into natural language and maps human class-level specifications to image-level critiques, enabling effective interaction between domain experts and the model. Our method demonstrates substantial improvement in aligning model behavior with human specifications, as validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We show that it effectively reduces the model's dependence on spurious features and on group-specific biases, without requiring fine-grained feedback.</p></details> |  |

However, their widespread accessibility raises critical concerns about potential copyright infringement. Will LVLMs accurately recognize and comply with copyright regulations when encountering copyrighted content (i.e., user input, retrieved documents) in the context? Failure to comply with copyright regulations may lead to serious legal and ethical consequences, particularly when LVLMs generate responses based on copyrighted materials (e.g., retrieved book experts, news reports). In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of various LVLMs, examining how they handle copyrighted content -- such as book excerpts, news articles, music lyrics, and code documentation when they are presented as visual inputs. To systematically measure copyright compliance, we introduce a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 50,000 multimodal query-content pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LVLMs handle queries that could lead to copyright infringement. Given that real-world copyrighted content may or may not include a copyright notice, the dataset includes query-content pairs in two distinct scenarios: with and without a copyright notice. For the former, we extensively cover four types of copyright notices to account for different cases. Our evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art closed-source LVLMs exhibit significant deficiencies in recognizing and respecting the copyrighted content, even when presented with the copyright notice. To solve this limitation, we introduce a novel tool-augmented defense framework for copyright compliance, which reduces infringement risks in all scenarios. Our findings underscore the importance of developing copyright-aware LVLMs to ensure the responsible and lawful use of copyrighted content.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 (Oral) |
| **[Frozen LVLMs for Micro-Video Recommendation: A Systematic Study of Feature Extraction and Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21863v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frozen Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly employed in micro-video recommendation due to their strong multimodal understanding. However, their integration lacks systematic empirical evaluation: practitioners typically deploy LVLMs as fixed black-box feature extractors without systematically comparing alternative representation strategies. To address this gap, we present the first systematic empirical study along two key design dimensions: (i) integration strategies with ID embeddings, specifically replacement versus fusion, and (ii) feature extraction paradigms, comparing LVLM-generated captions with intermediate decoder hidden states. Extensive experiments on representative LVLMs reveal three key principles: (1) intermediate hidden states consistently outperform caption-based representations, as natural-language summarization inevitably discards fine-grained visual semantics crucial for recommendation; (2) ID embeddings capture irreplaceable collaborative signals, rendering fusion strictly superior to replacement; and (3) the effectiveness of intermediate decoder features varies significantly across layers. Guided by these insights, we propose the Dual Feature Fusion (DFF) Framework, a lightweight and plug-and-play approach that adaptively fuses multi-layer representations from frozen LVLMs with item ID embeddings. DFF achieves state-of-the-art performance on two real-world micro-video recommendation benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines and providing a principled approach to integrating off-the-shelf large vision-language models into micro-video recommender systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Training-free Conditional Image Embedding Framework Leveraging Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21860v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional image embeddings are feature representations that focus on specific aspects of an image indicated by a given textual condition (e.g., color, genre), which has been a challenging problem. Although recent vision foundation models, such as CLIP, offer rich representations of images, they are not designed to focus on a specified condition. In this paper, we propose DIOR, a method that leverages a large vision-language model (LVLM) to generate conditional image embeddings. DIOR is a training-free approach that prompts the LVLM to describe an image with a single word related to a given condition. The hidden state vector of the LVLM's last token is then extracted as the conditional image embedding. DIOR provides a versatile solution that can be applied to any image and condition without additional training or task-specific priors. Comprehensive experimental results on conditional image similarity tasks demonstrate that DIOR outperforms existing training-free baselines, including CLIP. Furthermore, DIOR achieves superior performance compared to methods that require additional training across multiple settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboSafe: Safeguarding Embodied Agents via Executable Safety Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21220v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly capable of executing complex real-world tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to hazardous instructions that may trigger unsafe behaviors. Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Few Tokens Matter: Entropy Guided Attacks on Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21815v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Entropy, a measure of model uncertainty, is strongly correlated with the reliability of VLM. Prior entropy-based attacks maximize uncertainty at all decoding steps, implicitly assuming that every token contributes equally to generation instability. We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, across multiple representative VLMs, such selective attacks convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing a more critical safety risk. Remarkably, these vulnerable high-entropy forks recur across architecturally diverse VLMs, enabling feasible transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets). Motivated by these findings, we propose Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA), which achieves competitive attack success rates (93-95%) alongside high harmful conversion, thereby revealing new weaknesses in current VLM safety mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 Pa...</summary><p>19 Pages,11 figures,8 tables</p></details> |

Existing encoder-based methods are limited by visual-centric biases, classify each shot in isolation without leveraging sequential dependencies, and lack both narrative understanding and explainability. In this paper, we present Scene-VLM, the first fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) framework for video scene segmentation. Scene-VLM jointly processes visual and textual cues including frames, transcriptions, and optional metadata to enable multimodal reasoning across consecutive shots. The model generates predictions sequentially with causal dependencies among shots and introduces a context-focus window mechanism to ensure sufficient temporal context for each shot-level decision. In addition, we propose a scheme to extract confidence scores from the token-level logits of the VLM, enabling controllable precision-recall trade-offs that were previously limited to encoder-based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model can be aligned to generate coherent natural-language rationales for its boundary decisions through minimal targeted supervision. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard scene segmentation benchmarks. On MovieNet, for example, Scene-VLM yields significant improvements of +6 AP and +13.7 F1 over the previous leading method.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAction-SocialNav: Multi-Action Socially Compliant Navigation via Reasoning-enhanced Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21722v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Socially compliant navigation requires robots to move safely and appropriately in human-centered environments by respecting social norms. However, social norms are often ambiguous, and in a single scenario, multiple actions may be equally acceptable. Most existing methods simplify this problem by assuming a single correct action, which limits their ability to handle real-world social uncertainty. In this work, we propose MAction-SocialNav, an efficient vision language model for socially compliant navigation that explicitly addresses action ambiguity, enabling generating multiple plausible actions within one scenario. To enhance the model's reasoning capability, we introduce a novel meta-cognitive prompt (MCP) method. Furthermore, to evaluate the proposed method, we curate a multi-action socially compliant navigation dataset that accounts for diverse conditions, including crowd density, indoor and outdoor environments, and dual human annotations. The dataset contains 789 samples, each with three-turn conversation, split into 710 training samples and 79 test samples through random selection. We also design five evaluation metrics to assess high-level decision precision, safety, and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MAction-SocialNav achieves strong social reasoning performance while maintaining high efficiency, highlighting its potential for real-world human robot navigation. Compared with zero-shot GPT-4o and Claude, our model achieves substantially higher decision quality (APG: 0.595 vs. 0.000/0.025) and safety alignment (ER: 0.264 vs. 0.642/0.668), while maintaining real-time efficiency (1.524 FPS, over 3x faster).</p></details> |  |

Yet, current vision language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across 62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g., temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT4o and Gemini 2.0 for stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERTF1 0.902) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards Responsible and Explainable AI Agents with Consensus-Driven Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21699v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI represents a major shift in how autonomous systems reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks through the coordination of Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Language Models (VLMs), tools, and external services. While these systems enable powerful new capabilities, increasing autonomy introduces critical challenges related to explainability, accountability, robustness, and governance, especially when agent outputs influence downstream actions or decisions. Existing agentic AI implementations often emphasize functionality and scalability, yet provide limited mechanisms for understanding decision rationale or enforcing responsibility across agent interactions. This paper presents a Responsible(RAI) and Explainable(XAI) AI Agent Architecture for production-grade agentic workflows based on multi-model consensus and reasoning-layer governance. In the proposed design, a consortium of heterogeneous LLM and VLM agents independently generates candidate outputs from a shared input context, explicitly exposing uncertainty, disagreement, and alternative interpretations. A dedicated reasoning agent then performs structured consolidation across these outputs, enforcing safety and policy constraints, mitigating hallucinations and bias, and producing auditable, evidence-backed decisions. Explainability is achieved through explicit cross-model comparison and preserved intermediate outputs, while responsibility is enforced through centralized reasoning-layer control and agent-level constraints. We evaluate the architecture across multiple real-world agentic AI workflows, demonstrating that consensus-driven reasoning improves robustness, transparency, and operational trust across diverse application domains. This work provides practical guidance for designing agentic AI systems that are autonomous and scalable, yet responsible and explainable by construction.</p></details> |  |
| **[SlideChain: Semantic Provenance for Lecture Understanding via Blockchain Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21684v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern vision--language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to interpret and generate educational content, yet their semantic outputs remain challenging to verify, reproduce, and audit over time. Inconsistencies across model families, inference settings, and computing environments undermine the reliability of AI-generated instructional material, particularly in high-stakes and quantitative STEM domains. This work introduces SlideChain, a blockchain-backed provenance framework designed to provide verifiable integrity for multimodal semantic extraction at scale. Using the SlideChain Slides Dataset-a curated corpus of 1,117 medical imaging lecture slides from a university course-we extract concepts and relational triples from four state-of-the-art VLMs and construct structured provenance records for every slide. SlideChain anchors cryptographic hashes of these records on a local EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)-compatible blockchain, providing tamper-evident auditability and persistent semantic baselines. Through the first systematic analysis of semantic disagreement, cross-model similarity, and lecture-level variability in multimodal educational content, we reveal pronounced cross-model discrepancies, including low concept overlap and near-zero agreement in relational triples on many slides. We further evaluate gas usage, throughput, and scalability under simulated deployment conditions, and demonstrate perfect tamper detection along with deterministic reproducibility across independent extraction runs. Together, these results show that SlideChain provides a practical and scalable step toward trustworthy, verifiable multimodal educational pipelines, supporting long-term auditability, reproducibility, and integrity for AI-assisted instructional systems.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we present a mechanistic interpretability framework for deepfake detection applied to a vision-language model. Our approach combines a sparse autoencoder (SAE) analysis of internal network representations with a novel forensic manifold analysis that probes how the model's features respond to controlled forensic artifact manipulations. We demonstrate that only a small fraction of latent features are actively used in each layer, and that the geometric properties of the model's feature manifold, including intrinsic dimensionality, curvature, and feature selectivity, vary systematically with different types of deepfake artifacts. These insights provide a first step toward opening the "black box" of deepfake detectors, allowing us to identify which learned features correspond to specific forensic artifacts and to guide the development of more interpretable and robust models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, Initial Work</p></details> |

The Predict, Prevent, and Evaluate (PPE) framework addresses this issue by leveraging pre-trained vision-language models for disentangled editing. In this work, we analyze the PPE framework, focusing on its architectural components, including BERT-based attribute prediction and StyleGAN2-based image generation on the CelebA-HQ dataset. Through empirical analysis, we identify a limitation in the original regularization strategy, where latent updates remain dense and prone to semantic leakage. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a sparsity-based constraint using L1 regularization on latent space manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach enforces more focused and controlled edits, effectively reducing unintended changes in non-target attributes while preserving facial identity.</p></details> |  |

Existing multimodal models often produce hallucinations or inconsistent chains of thought, limiting clinical trust. We propose a diagnostic framework built upon LLaVA that combines vision-language alignment with logic-regularized reasoning. The system includes an input encoder for text and images, a projection module for cross-modal alignment, a reasoning controller that decomposes diagnostic tasks into steps, and a logic tree generator that assembles stepwise premises into verifiable conclusions. Evaluations on MedXpertQA and other benchmarks show that our method improves diagnostic accuracy and yields more interpretable reasoning traces on multimodal tasks, while remaining competitive on text-only settings. These results suggest a promising step toward trustworthy multimodal medical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Long-window Anchoring in Vision-Language Model Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21576v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong long-context understanding, their prevalent small branches fail on linguistics-photography alignment for a limited window size. We discover that knowledge distillation improves students' capability as a complement to Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) on window sizes (anchored from large models). Building on this insight, we propose LAid, which directly aims at the transfer of long-range attention mechanisms through two complementary components: (1) a progressive distance-weighted attention matching that dynamically emphasizes longer position differences during training, and (2) a learnable RoPE response gain modulation that selectively amplifies position sensitivity where needed. Extensive experiments across multiple model families demonstrate that LAid-distilled models achieve up to 3.2 times longer effective context windows compared to baseline small models, while maintaining or improving performance on standard VL benchmarks. Spectral analysis also suggests that LAid successfully preserves crucial low-frequency attention components that conventional methods fail to transfer. Our work not only provides practical techniques for building more efficient long-context VLMs but also offers theoretical insights into how positional understanding emerges and transfers during distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

While vision-language models (VLMs) and diffusion models enable guided visual manipulation, existing work rarely ensures that inserted objects are \emph{contextually appropriate}. We introduce two new tasks for advertising and digital media: (1) \emph{context-aware object insertion}, which requires predicting suitable object categories, generating them, and placing them plausibly within the scene; and (2) \emph{sponsor-product logo augmentation}, which involves detecting products and inserting correct brand logos, even when items are unbranded or incorrectly branded. To support these tasks, we build two new datasets with category annotations, placement regions, and sponsor-product labels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Evidence Multimodal Reasoning for Few-shot Temporal Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13460v5)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional temporal action localization (TAL) methods rely on large amounts of detailed annotated data, whereas few-shot TAL reduces this dependence by using only a few training samples to identify unseen action categories. However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the action localization task. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Evidence multimodal reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level, we design a Chain-of-Evidence (CoE) reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoE text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3, THUMOS14 and our newly collected Human-related Anomaly Localization Dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios.

| **[Hierarchy-Aware Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21529v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn powerful multimodal representations through large-scale image-text pretraining, but adapting them to hierarchical classification is underexplored. Standard approaches treat labels as flat categories and require full fine-tuning, which is expensive and produces inconsistent predictions across taxonomy levels. We propose an efficient hierarchy-aware fine-tuning framework that updates a few parameters while enforcing structural consistency. We combine two objectives: Tree-Path KL Divergence (TP-KL) aligns predictions along the ground-truth label path for vertical coherence, while Hierarchy-Sibling Smoothed Cross-Entropy (HiSCE) encourages consistent predictions among sibling classes. Both losses work in the VLM's shared embedding space and integrate with lightweight LoRA adaptation. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements in Full-Path Accuracy and Tree-based Inconsistency Error with minimal parameter overhead. Our approach provides an efficient strategy for adapting VLMs to structured taxonomies.</p></details> |  |
| **[GateBreaker: Gate-Guided Attacks on Mixture-of-Expert LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21008v2)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have advanced the scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) by activating only a sparse subset of parameters per input, enabling state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational cost. As these models are increasingly deployed in critical domains, understanding and strengthening their alignment mechanisms is essential to prevent harmful outputs. However, existing LLM safety research has focused almost exclusively on dense architectures, leaving the unique safety properties of MoEs largely unexamined. The modular, sparsely-activated design of MoEs suggests that safety mechanisms may operate differently than in dense models, raising questions about their robustness. In this paper, we present GateBreaker, the first training-free, lightweight, and architecture-agnostic attack framework that compromises the safety alignment of modern MoE LLMs at inference time. GateBreaker operates in three stages: (i) gate-level profiling, which identifies safety experts disproportionately routed on harmful inputs, (ii) expert-level localization, which localizes the safety structure within safety experts, and (iii) targeted safety removal, which disables the identified safety structure to compromise the safety alignment. Our study shows that MoE safety concentrates within a small subset of neurons coordinated by sparse routing. Selective disabling of these neurons, approximately 3% of neurons in the targeted expert layers, significantly increases the averaged attack success rate (ASR) from 7.4% to 64.9% against the eight latest aligned MoE LLMs with limited utility degradation. These safety neurons transfer across models within the same family, raising ASR from 17.9% to 67.7% with one-shot transfer attack. Furthermore, GateBreaker generalizes to five MoE vision language models (VLMs) with 60.9% ASR on unsafe image inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security'26</p></details> |

We study parameter-efficient training (PET) strategies, including frozen encoders, BitFit, LoRA, and adapters for multi-label classification on the Indiana University Chest X-Ray dataset (3,851 image-report pairs; 579 test samples). To mitigate data leakage, we redact pathology terms from reports used as text inputs while retaining clinical context. Under a fixed parameter budget (2.37M parameters, 2.51% of total), all PET variants achieve AUROC between 0.892 and 0.908, outperforming full fine-tuning (0.770 AUROC), which uses 94.3M trainable parameters, a 40x reduction. External validation on CheXpert (224,316 images, 58x larger) confirms scalability: all PET methods achieve >0.69 AUROC with <9% trainable parameters, with Adapter achieving best performance (0.7214 AUROC). Budget-matched comparisons reveal that vision-only models (0.653 AUROC, 1.06M parameters) outperform budget-matched multimodal models (0.641 AUROC, 1.06M parameters), indicating improvements arise primarily from parameter allocation rather than cross-modal synergy. While PET methods show degraded calibration (ECE: 0.29-0.34) compared to simpler models (ECE: 0.049), this represents a tractable limitation addressable through post-hoc calibration methods. These findings demonstrate that frozen encoder strategies provide superior discrimination at substantially reduced computational cost, though calibration correction is essential for clinical deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 28th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT). 6 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce DAVE, a vision encoder purpose-built for VLMs and tailored for these tasks. Our training pipeline is designed to leverage abundant unlabeled data to bypass the need for costly large-scale annotations for document and web images. We begin with a self-supervised pretraining stage on unlabeled images, followed by a supervised autoregressive pretraining stage, where the model learns tasks like parsing and localization from limited, high-quality data. Within the supervised stage, we adopt two strategies to improve our encoder's alignment with both general visual knowledge and diverse document and web agentic tasks: (i) We introduce a novel model-merging scheme, combining encoders trained with different text decoders to ensure broad compatibility with different web agentic architectures. (ii) We use ensemble training to fuse features from pretrained generalist encoders (e.g., SigLIP2) with our own document and web-specific representations. Extensive experiments on classic document tasks, VQAs, web localization, and agent-based benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing DAVE as a strong vision encoder for document and web applications.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Tool Bottleneck Framework for Clinically-Informed and Interpretable Medical Image Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21414v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent tool-use frameworks powered by vision-language models (VLMs) improve image understanding by grounding model predictions with specialized tools. Broadly, these frameworks leverage VLMs and a pre-specified toolbox to decompose the prediction task into multiple tool calls (often deep learning models) which are composed to make a prediction. The dominant approach to composing tools is using text, via function calls embedded in VLM-generated code or natural language. However, these methods often perform poorly on medical image understanding, where salient information is encoded as spatially-localized features that are difficult to compose or fuse via text alone. To address this, we propose a tool-use framework for medical image understanding called the Tool Bottleneck Framework (TBF), which composes VLM-selected tools using a learned Tool Bottleneck Model (TBM). For a given image and task, TBF leverages an off-the-shelf medical VLM to select tools from a toolbox that each extract clinically-relevant features. Instead of text-based composition, these tools are composed by the TBM, which computes and fuses the tool outputs using a neural network before outputting the final prediction. We propose a simple and effective strategy for TBMs to make predictions with any arbitrary VLM tool selection. Overall, our framework not only improves tool-use in medical imaging contexts, but also yields more interpretable, clinically-grounded predictors. We evaluate TBF on tasks in histopathology and dermatology and find that these advantages enable our framework to perform on par with or better than deep learning-based classifiers, VLMs, and state-of-the-art tool-use frameworks, with particular gains in data-limited regimes.

While existing frameworks like VideoScore-2 assess visual and semantic fidelity, they do not capture how specific audiovisual attributes drive real audience engagement. In this work, we propose a data-driven evaluation framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract unsupervised audiovisual features, clusters them into interpretable factors, and trains a regression-based evaluator to predict engagement on short-form edutainment videos. Our curated YouTube Shorts dataset enables systematic analysis of how VLM-derived features relate to human engagement behavior. Experiments show strong correlations between predicted and actual engagement, demonstrating that our lightweight, feature-based evaluator provides interpretable and scalable assessments compared to traditional metrics (e.g., SSIM, FID). By grounding evaluation in both multimodal feature importance and human-centered engagement signals, our approach advances toward robust and explainable video understanding.</p></details> | Under Review |

To systematically investigate this, we introduce the largest open benchmark for this task: the YearGuessr dataset, a collection of 55,546 building images with multi-modal attributes from 157 countries, annotated with continuous ordinal labels of their construction year (1001-2024), GPS data, and page-view counts as a proxy for popularity. Using this dataset, we frame the construction year prediction task as ordinal regression and introduce popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to quantify this bias. Our resulting benchmark of 30+ models, including our YearCLIP model, confirms that VLMs excel on popular, memorized items but struggle significantly with unrecognized subjects, exposing a critical flaw in their reasoning capabilities.

| **[Your Reasoning Benchmark May Not Test Reasoning: Revealing Perception Bottleneck in Abstract Reasoning Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21329v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning benchmarks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) and ARC-AGI are widely used to assess progress in artificial intelligence and are often interpreted as probes of core, so-called ``fluid'' reasoning abilities. Despite their apparent simplicity for humans, these tasks remain challenging for frontier vision-language models (VLMs), a gap commonly attributed to deficiencies in machine reasoning. We challenge this interpretation and hypothesize that the gap arises primarily from limitations in visual perception rather than from shortcomings in inductive reasoning. To verify this hypothesis, we introduce a two-stage experimental pipeline that explicitly separates perception and reasoning. In the perception stage, each image is independently converted into a natural-language description, while in the reasoning stage a model induces and applies rules using these descriptions. This design prevents leakage of cross-image inductive signals and isolates reasoning from perception bottlenecks. Across three ARC-style datasets, Mini-ARC, ACRE, and Bongard-LOGO, we show that the perception capability is the dominant factor underlying the observed performance gap by comparing the two-stage pipeline with against standard end-to-end one-stage evaluation. Manual inspection of reasoning traces in the VLM outputs further reveals that approximately 80 percent of model failures stem from perception errors. Together, these results demonstrate that ARC-style benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning challenges and that observed performance gaps may overstate deficiencies in machine reasoning. Our findings underscore the need for evaluation protocols that disentangle perception from reasoning when assessing progress in machine intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[LookPlanGraph: Embodied Instruction Following Method with VLM Graph Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21243v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Methods that use Large Language Models (LLM) as planners for embodied instruction following tasks have become widespread. To successfully complete tasks, the LLM must be grounded in the environment in which the robot operates. One solution is to use a scene graph that contains all the necessary information. Modern methods rely on prebuilt scene graphs and assume that all task-relevant information is available at the start of planning. However, these approaches do not account for changes in the environment that may occur between the graph construction and the task execution. We propose LookPlanGraph - a method that leverages a scene graph composed of static assets and object priors. During plan execution, LookPlanGraph continuously updates the graph with relevant objects, either by verifying existing priors or discovering new entities. This is achieved by processing the agents egocentric camera view using a Vision Language Model. We conducted experiments with changed object positions VirtualHome and OmniGibson simulated environments, demonstrating that LookPlanGraph outperforms methods based on predefined static scene graphs. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we also conducted experiments in a real-world setting. Additionally, we introduce the GraSIF (Graph Scenes for Instruction Following) dataset with automated validation framework, comprising 514 tasks drawn from SayPlan Office, BEHAVIOR-1K, and VirtualHome RobotHow.

However, real-world image-text retrieval remains challenging due to vague or context-dependent queries, linguistic variability, and the need for scalable solutions. In this work, we propose a lightweight two-stage retrieval pipeline that leverages event-centric entity extraction to incorporate temporal and contextual signals from real-world captions. The first stage performs efficient candidate filtering using BM25 based on salient entities, while the second stage applies BEiT-3 models to capture deep multimodal semantics and rerank the results. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 benchmark, our method achieves a mean average precision of 0.559, substantially outperforming prior baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining event-guided filtering with long-text vision-language modeling for accurate and efficient retrieval in complex, real-world scenarios.

Yet, the extent to which these models perform visual reasoning as opposed to relying on linguistic priors remains unclear. To address this, we introduce VisRes Bench, a benchmark designed to study visual reasoning in naturalistic settings without contextual language supervision. Analyzing model behavior across three levels of complexity, we uncover clear limitations in perceptual and relational visual reasoning capacities. VisRes isolates distinct reasoning abilities across its levels. Level 1 probes perceptual completion and global image matching under perturbations such as blur, texture changes, occlusion, and rotation; Level 2 tests rule-based inference over a single attribute (e.g., color, count, orientation); and Level 3 targets compositional reasoning that requires integrating multiple visual attributes. Across more than 19,000 controlled task images, we find that state-of-the-art VLMs perform near random under subtle perceptual perturbations, revealing limited abstraction beyond pattern recognition. We conclude by discussing how VisRes provides a unified framework for advancing abstract visual reasoning in multimodal research.</p></details> |  |

However, they often fail to utilize visual evidence adequately, either depending on linguistic priors in vision-centric tasks or resorting to textual shortcuts during reasoning. Although reinforcement learning (RL) can align models with desired behaviors, its application to VLMs has been hindered by the lack of scalable and reliable reward mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose SSL4RL, a novel framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks as a source of verifiable rewards for RL-based fine-tuning. Our approach reformulates SSL objectives-such as predicting image rotation or reconstructing masked patches-into dense, automatic reward signals, eliminating the need for human preference data or unreliable AI evaluators. Experiments show that SSL4RL substantially improves performance on both vision-centric and vision-language reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, through systematic ablations, we identify key factors-such as task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with the target domain-that influence the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks, offering new design principles for future work. We also demonstrate the framework's generality by applying it to graph learning, where it yields significant gains. SSL4RL establishes a versatile and effective paradigm for aligning multimodal models using verifiable, self-supervised objectives.</p></details> |  |

Self-distillation recently is emerging as a promising approach for fine-tuning VLMs to better adapt to local regions without requiring extensive annotations. However, previous state-of-the-art approaches often suffer from significant `foreground bias', where models tend to wrongly identify background regions as foreground objects. To alleviate this issue, we propose DenseVLM, a framework designed to learn unbiased region-language alignment from powerful pre-trained VLM representations. To alleviate this issue, we propose DenseVLM, a framework designed to learn unbiased region-language alignment from powerful pre-trained VLM representations. DenseVLM leverages the pre-trained VLM to retrieve categories for unlabeled regions and then decouples the interference between foreground and background features. We show that DenseVLM can directly replace the original VLM in open-vocabulary object detection and image segmentation methods, leading to notable performance improvements.

| **[Intersectional Fairness in Vision-Language Models for Medical Image Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15249v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly multimodal vision-language models (VLM), often exhibit intersectional biases where models are systematically less confident in diagnosing marginalised patient subgroups. Such bias can lead to higher rates of inaccurate and missed diagnoses due to demographically skewed data and divergent distributions of diagnostic certainty. Current fairness interventions frequently fail to address these gaps or compromise overall diagnostic performance to achieve statistical parity among the subgroups. In this study, we developed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD), a training framework that standardises diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups. Unlike traditional debiasing methods, this approach equalises the model's decision confidence without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference. We evaluated this approach using 10,015 skin lesion images (HAM10000) with external validation on 12,000 images (BCN20000), and 10,000 fundus images for glaucoma detection (Harvard-FairVLMed), stratifying performance by intersectional age, gender, and race attributes. In the dermatology cohort, the proposed method reduced the overall intersectional missed diagnosis gap (difference in True Positive Rate, $Δ$TPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving the overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.94 to 0.97 compared to standard training. Similarly, for glaucoma screening, the method reduced $Δ$TPR from 0.41 to 0.31, achieving a better AUC of 0.72 (vs. 0.71 baseline). This establishes a scalable framework for developing high-stakes clinical decision support systems that are both accurate and can perform equitably across diverse patient subgroups, ensuring reliable performance without increasing privacy risks.</p></details> |  |

VLMs, as a bridge to connect the visual world and language corpus, receive both visual content and various text-only user instructions to generate corresponding responses. Though great success has been achieved by VLMs in various fields, in this work, we ask whether the existing VLMs can act as domain experts, accurately answering marine questions, which require significant domain expertise and address special domain challenges/requirements. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and explore the boundary of existing VLMs, we construct the first large-scale marine VLM dataset and benchmark called MarineEval, with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs. During our dataset construction, we ensure the diversity and coverage of the constructed data: 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions. The domain requirements are specially integrated into the data construction and further verified by the corresponding marine domain experts. We comprehensively benchmark 17 existing VLMs on our MarineEval and also investigate the limitations of existing models in answering marine research questions. The experimental results reveal that existing VLMs cannot effectively answer the domain-specific questions, and there is still a large room for further performance improvements. We hope our new benchmark and observations will facilitate future research.

Accurately and efficiently recognizing both is crucial for developing robust and generalizable document parsing systems. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive unified recognition of text and formulas. However, they are large-sized and computationally demanding, restricting their usage in many applications. In this paper, we propose UniRec-0.1B, a unified recognition model with only 0.1B parameters. It is capable of performing text and formula recognition at multiple levels, including characters, words, lines, paragraphs, and documents. To implement this task, we first establish UniRec40M, a large-scale dataset comprises 40 million text, formula and their mix samples, enabling the training of a powerful yet lightweight model. Secondly, we identify two challenges when building such a lightweight but unified expert model. They are: structural variability across hierarchies and semantic entanglement between textual and formulaic content. To tackle these, we introduce a hierarchical supervision training that explicitly guides structural comprehension, and a semantic-decoupled tokenizer that separates text and formula representations. Finally, we develop a comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering Chinese and English documents from multiple domains and with multiple levels. Experimental results on this and public benchmarks demonstrate that UniRec-0.1B outperforms both general-purpose VLMs and leading document parsing expert models, while achieving a 2-9$\times$ speedup, validating its effectiveness and efficiency.

Specifically, they struggle to comprehend hand-drawn sketches, a modality that offers an intuitive means of expressing concepts that are difficult to describe textually. We identify the primary bottleneck as the absence of a large-scale dataset that jointly models sketches, photorealistic images, and corresponding natural language instructions. To address this, we present two key contributions: (1) a new, large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets designed to facilitate both pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple sketch-based tasks: (a) object localization, (b) counting, (c) image retrieval i.e., (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and (d) visual question answering (VQA); while incorporating the three existing sketch datasets, namely QuickDraw!, Sketchy, and Tu Berlin, along with our generated SketchVCL dataset, show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, current research predominantly relies on data-driven approaches that necessitate extensive training datasets to achieve robust multimodal decision-making capabilities and generalizable visuomotor control. These methods raise concerns due to the neglect of geometric reasoning in unseen scenarios and the inefficient modeling of robot-target relationships within the training data, resulting in significant waste of training resources. To address these limitations, we present the Recurrent Geometric-prior Multimodal Policy (RGMP), an end-to-end framework that unifies geometric-semantic skill reasoning with data-efficient visuomotor control. For perception capabilities, we propose the Geometric-prior Skill Selector, which infuses geometric inductive biases into a vision language model, producing adaptive skill sequences for unseen scenes with minimal spatial common sense tuning. To achieve data-efficient robotic motion synthesis, we introduce the Adaptive Recursive Gaussian Network, which parameterizes robot-object interactions as a compact hierarchy of Gaussian processes that recursively encode multi-scale spatial relationships, yielding dexterous, data-efficient motion synthesis even from sparse demonstrations. Evaluated on both our humanoid robot and desktop dual-arm robot, the RGMP framework achieves 87% task success in generalization tests and exhibits 5x greater data efficiency than the state-of-the-art model. This performance underscores its superior cross-domain generalization, enabled by geometric-semantic reasoning and recursive-Gaussion adaptation.</p></details> |  |

While current graph-based methods offer an efficient, structured approach by abstracting the environment into a topological map and simplifying the action space to waypoint selection, they lag behind methods based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in leveraging large-scale data and advanced training paradigms. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap by introducing ETP-R1, a framework that applies the paradigm of scaling up data and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to a graph-based VLN-CE model. To build a strong foundation, we first construct a high-quality, large-scale pretraining dataset using the Gemini API. This dataset consists of diverse, low-hallucination instructions for topological trajectories, providing rich supervision for our graph-based policy to map language to topological paths. This foundation is further strengthened by unifying data from both R2R and RxR tasks for joint pretraining. Building on this, we introduce a three-stage training paradigm, which culminates in the first application of closed-loop, online RFT to a graph-based VLN-CE model, powered by the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is highly effective, establishing new state-of-the-art performance across all major metrics on both the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks.

| **[Transductive Visual Programming: Evolving Tool Libraries from Experience for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20934v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning in 3D scenes requires precise geometric calculations that challenge vision-language models. Visual programming addresses this by decomposing problems into steps calling specialized tools, yet existing methods rely on either fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before solving problems, resulting in suboptimal programs and poor utilization of induced tools. We present Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), a novel framework that builds new tools from its own experience rather than speculation. TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating experiential solutions into an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns from these programs into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library. This allows TVP to tackle new problems with increasingly powerful tools learned from experience. On Omni3D-Bench, TVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 22% and the previous best visual programming system by 11%. Our transductively learned tools are used 5x more frequently as core program dependency than inductively created ones, demonstrating more effective tool discovery and reuse. The evolved tools also show strong generalization to unseen spatial tasks, achieving superior performance on benchmarks from SpatialScore-Hard collection without any testset-specific modification. Our work establishes experience-driven transductive tool creation as a powerful paradigm for building self-evolving visual programming agents that effectively tackle challenging spatial reasoning tasks.

| **[DiffusionVL: Translating Any Autoregressive Models into Diffusion Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15713v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent multimodal research, the diffusion paradigm has emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm (AR), owing to its unique decoding advantages. However, due to the capability limitations of the base diffusion language model, the performance of the diffusion vision language model (dVLM) still lags significantly behind that of mainstream models. This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning. Further, we introduce a block-decoding design into dVLMs that supports arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse, achieving a significant inference speedup. We conduct a large number of experiments. Despite training with less than 5% of the data required by prior methods, DiffusionVL achieves a comprehensive performance improvement-a 34.4% gain on the MMMU-Pro (vision) bench and 37.5% gain on the MME (Cog.) bench-alongside a 2x inference speedup. The model and code are released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiffusionVL.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, conference or other essential info</p></details> |

Traditional supervised models leverage explicit 3D geometry but exhibit limited generalization, owing to the scarcity of 3D vision-language datasets and the limited reasoning capabilities compared to modern vision-language models (VLMs). We propose PanoGrounder, a generalizable 3DVG framework that couples multi-modal panoramic representation with pretrained 2D VLMs for strong vision-language reasoning. Panoramic renderings, augmented with 3D semantic and geometric features, serve as an intermediate representation between 2D and 3D, and offer two major benefits: (i) they can be directly fed to VLMs with minimal adaptation and (ii) they retain long-range object-to-object relations thanks to their 360-degree field of view. We devise a three-stage pipeline that places a compact set of panoramic viewpoints considering the scene layout and geometry, grounds a text query on each panoramic rendering with a VLM, and fuses per-view predictions into a single 3D bounding box via lifting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on ScanRefer and Nr3D, and demonstrates superior generalization to unseen 3D datasets and text rephrasings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking and Enhancing VLM for Compressed Image Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20901v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and the growing demand for their applications, efficient compression of the image inputs has become increasingly important. Existing VLMs predominantly digest and understand high-bitrate compressed images, while their ability to interpret low-bitrate compressed images has yet to be explored by far. In this paper, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the ability of VLM against compressed images, varying existing widely used image codecs and diverse set of tasks, encompassing over one million compressed images in our benchmark. Next, we analyse the source of performance gap, by categorising the gap from a) the information loss during compression and b) generalisation failure of VLM. We visualize these gaps with concrete examples and identify that for compressed images, only the generalization gap can be mitigated. Finally, we propose a universal VLM adaptor to enhance model performance on images compressed by existing codecs. Consequently, we demonstrate that a single adaptor can improve VLM performance across images with varying codecs and bitrates by 10%-30%. We believe that our benchmark and enhancement method provide valuable insights and contribute toward bridging the gap between VLMs and compressed images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proprioception Enhances Vision Language Model in Generating Captions and Subtask Segmentations for Robot Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20876v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From the perspective of future developments in robotics, it is crucial to verify whether foundation models trained exclusively on offline data, such as images and language, can understand the robot motion. In particular, since Vision Language Models (VLMs) do not include low-level motion information from robots in their training datasets, video understanding including trajectory information remains a significant challenge. In this study, we assess two capabilities of VLMs through a video captioning task with low-level robot motion information: (1) automatic captioning of robot tasks and (2) segmentation of a series of tasks. Both capabilities are expected to enhance the efficiency of robot imitation learning by linking language and motion and serve as a measure of the foundation model's performance. The proposed method generates multiple "scene" captions using image captions and trajectory data from robot tasks. The full task caption is then generated by summarizing these individual captions. Additionally, the method performs subtask segmentation by comparing the similarity between text embeddings of image captions. In both captioning tasks, the proposed method aims to improve performance by providing the robot's motion data - joint and end-effector states - as input to the VLM. Simulator experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

While single-snapshot imagery dominates current resources, it fails to capture dynamic disaster impacts over time. To address this gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark comprising 62,351 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods, wildfires, and more) paired with rich, human-like change captions. By bridging the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate, interpretable, and scalable vision-language applications in remote sensing.

| **[Input-Adaptive Visual Preprocessing for Efficient Fast Vision-Language Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20839v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on multimodal reasoning tasks, but their deployment remains challenging due to high inference latency and computational cost, particularly when processing high-resolution visual inputs. While recent architectures such as FastVLM improve efficiency through optimized vision encoders, existing pipelines still rely on static visual preprocessing, leading to redundant computation for visually simple inputs. In this work, we propose an adaptive visual preprocessing method that dynamically adjusts input resolution and spatial coverage based on image content characteristics. The proposed approach combines content-aware image analysis, adaptive resolution selection, and content-aware cropping to reduce visual redundancy prior to vision encoding. Importantly, the method is integrated with FastVLM without modifying its architecture or requiring retraining. We evaluate the proposed method on a subset of the DocVQA dataset in an inference-only setting, focusing on efficiency-oriented metrics. Experimental results show that adaptive preprocessing reduces per-image inference time by over 50\%, lowers mean full generation time, and achieves a consistent reduction of more than 55\% in visual token count compared to the baseline pipeline. These findings demonstrate that input-aware preprocessing is an effective and lightweight strategy for improving deployment-oriented efficiency of vision-language models. To facilitate reproducibility, our implementation is provided as a fork of the FastVLM repository, incorporating the files for the proposed method, and is available at https://github.com/kmdavidds/mlfastlm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Soft Filtering: Guiding Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval with Prescriptive and Proscriptive Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20781v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to find a target image that aligns with user intent, expressed through a reference image and a modification text. While Zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) methods sidestep the need for labeled training data by leveraging pretrained vision-language models, they often rely on a single fused query that merges all descriptive cues of what the user wants, tending to dilute key information and failing to account for what they wish to avoid. Moreover, current CIR benchmarks assume a single correct target per query, overlooking the ambiguity in modification texts. To address these challenges, we propose Soft Filtering with Textual constraints (SoFT), a training-free, plug-and-play filtering module for ZS-CIR. SoFT leverages multimodal large language models (LLMs) to extract two complementary constraints from the reference-modification pair: prescriptive (must-have) and proscriptive (must-avoid) constraints. These serve as semantic filters that reward or penalize candidate images to re-rank results, without modifying the base retrieval model or adding supervision. In addition, we construct a two-stage dataset pipeline that refines CIR benchmarks. We first identify multiple plausible targets per query to construct multi-target triplets, capturing the open-ended nature of user intent. Then guide multimodal LLMs to rewrite the modification text to focus on one target, while referencing contrastive distractors to ensure precision. This enables more comprehensive and reliable evaluation under varying ambiguity levels. Applied on top of CIReVL, a ZS-CIR retriever, SoFT raises R@5 to 65.25 on CIRR (+12.94), mAP@50 to 27.93 on CIRCO (+6.13), and R@50 to 58.44 on FashionIQ (+4.59), demonstrating broad effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 Workshop on New Frontiers in Information Retrieval</p></details> |
| **[VL4Gaze: Unleashing Vision-Language Models for Gaze Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20735v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human gaze provides essential cues for interpreting attention, intention, and social interaction in visual scenes, yet gaze understanding remains largely unexplored in current vision-language models (VLMs). While recent VLMs achieve strong scene-level reasoning across a range of visual tasks, there exists no benchmark that systematically evaluates or trains them for gaze interpretation, leaving open the question of whether gaze understanding can emerge from general-purpose vision-language pre-training. To address this gap, we introduce VL4Gaze, the first large-scale benchmark designed to investigate, evaluate, and unlock the potential of VLMs for gaze understanding. VL4Gaze contains 489K automatically generated question-answer pairs across 124K images and formulates gaze understanding as a unified VQA problem through four complementary tasks: (1) gaze object description, (2) gaze direction description, (3) gaze point location, and (4) ambiguous question recognition. We comprehensively evaluate both commercial and open-source VLMs under in-context learning and fine-tuning settings. The results show that even large-scale VLMs struggle to reliably infer gaze semantics and spatial localization without task-specific supervision. In contrast, training on VL4Gaze brings substantial and consistent improvements across all tasks, highlighting the importance of targeted multi-task supervision for developing gaze understanding capabilities in VLMs. We will release the dataset and code to support further research and development in this direction.</p></details> |  |
| **[LightTact: A Visual-Tactile Fingertip Sensor for Deformation-Independent Contact Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20591v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contact often occurs without macroscopic surface deformation, such as during interaction with liquids, semi-liquids, or ultra-soft materials. Most existing tactile sensors rely on deformation to infer contact, making such light-contact interactions difficult to perceive robustly. To address this, we present LightTact, a visual-tactile fingertip sensor that makes contact directly visible via a deformation-independent, optics-based principle. LightTact uses an ambient-blocking optical configuration that suppresses both external light and internal illumination at non-contact regions, while transmitting only the diffuse light generated at true contacts. As a result, LightTact produces high-contrast raw images in which non-contact pixels remain near-black (mean gray value < 3) and contact pixels preserve the natural appearance of the contacting surface. Built on this, LightTact achieves accurate pixel-level contact segmentation that is robust to material properties, contact force, surface appearance, and environmental lighting. We further integrate LightTact on a robotic arm and demonstrate manipulation behaviors driven by extremely light contact, including water spreading, facial-cream dipping, and thin-film interaction. Finally, we show that LightTact's spatially aligned visual-tactile images can be directly interpreted by existing vision-language models, enabling resistor value reasoning for robotic sorting.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlashVLM: Text-Guided Visual Token Selection for Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20561v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (VLMs) typically process hundreds or thousands of visual tokens per image or video frame, incurring quadratic attention cost and substantial redundancy. Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment. We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context. Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression. Extensive experiments on 14 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that FlashVLM delivers state of the art efficiency performance trade offs while maintaining strong robustness and generalization across mainstream VLMs.</p></details> | Under submission |

| **[Aerial World Model for Long-horizon Visual Generation and Navigation in 3D Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21887v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as powerful embodied agents. One of the core abilities is autonomous navigation in large-scale three-dimensional environments. Existing navigation policies, however, are typically optimized for low-level objectives such as obstacle avoidance and trajectory smoothness, lacking the ability to incorporate high-level semantics into planning. To bridge this gap, we propose ANWM, an aerial navigation world model that predicts future visual observations conditioned on past frames and actions, thereby enabling agents to rank candidate trajectories by their semantic plausibility and navigational utility. ANWM is trained on 4-DoF UAV trajectories and introduces a physics-inspired module: Future Frame Projection (FFP), which projects past frames into future viewpoints to provide coarse geometric priors. This module mitigates representational uncertainty in long-distance visual generation and captures the mapping between 3D trajectories and egocentric observations. Empirical results demonstrate that ANWM significantly outperforms existing world models in long-distance visual forecasting and improves UAV navigation success rates in large-scale environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inducing Causal World Models in LLMs for Zero-Shot Physical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19855v4)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advanced linguistic capabilities, fundamentally lack an intuitive understanding of physical dynamics, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios that require causal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Causal World Model Induction (CWMI), a novel framework designed to embed an explicit model of causal physics within an LLM. Our approach incorporates a dedicated Causal Physics Module (CPM) and a new training objective called Causal Intervention Loss, encouraging the model to learn cause-and-effect relationships from multimodal data. By training the model to predict the outcomes of hypothetical interventions instead of merely capturing statistical correlations, CWMI develops a robust internal representation of physical laws. Experimental results show that CWMI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on zero-shot physical reasoning tasks, including the PIQA benchmark and our newly proposed PhysiCa-Bench dataset. These findings demonstrate that inducing a causal world model is a critical step toward more reliable and generalizable AI systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures, |
| **[AstraNav-World: World Model for Foresight Control and Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21714v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied navigation in open, dynamic environments demands accurate foresight of how the world will evolve and how actions will unfold over time. We propose AstraNav-World, an end-to-end world model that jointly reasons about future visual states and action sequences within a unified probabilistic framework. Our framework integrates a diffusion-based video generator with a vision-language policy, enabling synchronized rollouts where predicted scenes and planned actions are updated simultaneously. Training optimizes two complementary objectives: generating action-conditioned multi-step visual predictions and deriving trajectories conditioned on those predicted visuals. This bidirectional constraint makes visual predictions executable and keeps decisions grounded in physically consistent, task-relevant futures, mitigating cumulative errors common in decoupled "envision-then-plan" pipelines. Experiments across diverse embodied navigation benchmarks show improved trajectory accuracy and higher success rates. Ablations confirm the necessity of tight vision-action coupling and unified training, with either branch removal degrading both prediction quality and policy reliability. In real-world testing, AstraNav-World demonstrated exceptional zero-shot capabilities, adapting to previously unseen scenarios without any real-world fine-tuning. These results suggest that AstraNav-World captures transferable spatial understanding and planning-relevant navigation dynamics, rather than merely overfitting to simulation-specific data distribution. Overall, by unifying foresight vision and control within a single generative model, we move closer to reliable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied agents that operate robustly in open-ended real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Definition of Hallucination, Or: It's the World Model, Stupid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21577v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite numerous attempts to solve the issue of hallucination since the inception of neural language models, it remains a problem in even frontier large language models today. Why is this the case? We walk through definitions of hallucination used in the literature from a historical perspective up to the current day, and fold them into a single definition of hallucination, wherein different prior definitions focus on different aspects of our definition. At its core, we argue that hallucination is simply inaccurate (internal) world modeling, in a form where it is observable to the user (e.g., stating a fact which contradicts a knowledge base, or producing a summary which contradicts a known source). By varying the reference world model as well as the knowledge conflict policy (e.g., knowledge base vs. in-context), we arrive at the different existing definitions of hallucination present in the literature. We argue that this unified view is useful because it forces evaluations to make clear their assumed "world" or source of truth, clarifies what should and should not be called hallucination (as opposed to planning or reward/incentive-related errors), and provides a common language to compare benchmarks and mitigation techniques. Building on this definition, we outline plans for a family of benchmarks in which hallucinations are defined as mismatches with synthetic but fully specified world models in different environments, and sketch out how these benchmarks can use such settings to stress-test and improve the world modeling components of language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motus: A Unified Latent Action World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13030v2)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While a general embodied agent must function as a unified system, current methods are built on isolated models for understanding, world modeling, and control. This fragmentation prevents unifying multimodal generative capabilities and hinders learning from large-scale, heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose Motus, a unified latent action world model that leverages existing general pretrained models and rich, sharable motion information. Motus introduces a Mixture-of-Transformer (MoT) architecture to integrate three experts (i.e., understanding, video generation, and action) and adopts a UniDiffuser-style scheduler to enable flexible switching between different modeling modes (i.e., world models, vision-language-action models, inverse dynamics models, video generation models, and video-action joint prediction models). Motus further leverages the optical flow to learn latent actions and adopts a recipe with three-phase training pipeline and six-layer data pyramid, thereby extracting pixel-level "delta action" and enabling large-scale action pretraining. Experiments show that Motus achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation (a +15% improvement over X-VLA and a +45% improvement over Pi0.5) and real-world scenarios(improved by +11~48%), demonstrating unified modeling of all functionalities and priors significantly benefits downstream robotic tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object-Centric World Models for Causality-Aware Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14262v2)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models have been developed to support sample-efficient deep reinforcement learning agents. However, it remains challenging for world models to accurately replicate environments that are high-dimensional, non-stationary, and composed of multiple objects with rich interactions since most world models learn holistic representations of all environmental components. By contrast, humans perceive the environment by decomposing it into discrete objects, facilitating efficient decision-making. Motivated by this insight, we propose \emph{Slot Transformer Imagination with CAusality-aware reinforcement learning} (STICA), a unified framework in which object-centric Transformers serve as the world model and causality-aware policy and value networks. STICA represents each observation as a set of object-centric tokens, together with tokens for the agent action and the resulting reward, enabling the world model to predict token-level dynamics and interactions. The policy and value networks then estimate token-level cause--effect relations and use them in the attention layers, yielding causality-guided decision-making. Experiments on object-rich benchmarks demonstrate that STICA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agents in both sample efficiency and final performance.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI-26 |
| **[Schrödinger's Navigator: Imagining an Ensemble of Futures for Zero-Shot Object Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21201v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) requires a robot to locate a target object in a previously unseen environment without relying on pre-built maps or task-specific training. However, existing ZSON methods often struggle in realistic and cluttered environments, particularly when the scene contains heavy occlusions, unknown risks, or dynamically moving target objects. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Schrödinger's Navigator}, a navigation framework inspired by Schrödinger's thought experiment on uncertainty. The framework treats unobserved space as a set of plausible future worlds and reasons over them before acting. Conditioned on egocentric visual inputs and three candidate trajectories, a trajectory-conditioned 3D world model imagines future observations along each path. This enables the agent to see beyond occlusions and anticipate risks in unseen regions without requiring extra detours or dense global mapping. The imagined 3D observations are fused into the navigation map and used to update a value map. These updates guide the policy toward trajectories that avoid occlusions, reduce exposure to uncertain space, and better track moving targets. Experiments on a Go2 quadruped robot across three challenging scenarios, including severe static occlusions, unknown risks, and dynamically moving targets, show that Schrödinger's Navigator consistently outperforms strong ZSON baselines in self-localization, object localization, and overall Success Rate in occlusion-heavy environments. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of trajectory-conditioned 3D imagination in enabling robust zero-shot object navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active inference and artificial reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21129v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This technical note considers the sampling of outcomes that provide the greatest amount of information about the structure of underlying world models. This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or hypotheses. In active inference, policies - i.e., combinations of actions - are selected based on their expected free energy, which comprises expected information gain and value. Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design. We illustrate this kind of active selection or reasoning using partially observed discrete models; namely, a 'three-ball' paradigm used previously to describe artificial insight and 'aha moments' via (synthetic) introspection or sleep. We focus on the sample efficiency afforded by seeking outcomes that resolve the greatest uncertainty about the world model, under which outcomes are generated.</p></details> |  |
| **[AD-R1: Closed-Loop Reinforcement Learning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Impartial World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20325v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end models for autonomous driving hold the promise of learning complex behaviors directly from sensor data, but face critical challenges in safety and handling long-tail events. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising path to overcome these limitations, yet its success in autonomous driving has been elusive. We identify a fundamental flaw hindering this progress: a deep seated optimistic bias in the world models used for RL. To address this, we introduce a framework for post-training policy refinement built around an Impartial World Model. Our primary contribution is to teach this model to be honest about danger. We achieve this with a novel data synthesis pipeline, Counterfactual Synthesis, which systematically generates a rich curriculum of plausible collisions and off-road events. This transforms the model from a passive scene completer into a veridical forecaster that remains faithful to the causal link between actions and outcomes. We then integrate this Impartial World Model into our closed-loop RL framework, where it serves as an internal critic. During refinement, the agent queries the critic to ``dream" of the outcomes for candidate actions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments, including on a new Risk Foreseeing Benchmark, that our model significantly outperforms baselines in predicting failures. Consequently, when used as a critic, it enables a substantial reduction in safety violations in challenging simulations, proving that teaching a model to dream of danger is a critical step towards building truly safe and intelligent autonomous agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[FEM-Bench: A Structured Scientific Reasoning Benchmark for Evaluating Code-Generating LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20732v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLMs advance their reasoning capabilities about the physical world, the absence of rigorous benchmarks for evaluating their ability to generate scientifically valid physical models has become a critical gap. Computational mechanics, which develops and applies mathematical models and numerical methods to predict the behavior of physical systems under forces, deformation, and constraints, provides an ideal foundation for structured scientific reasoning evaluation. Problems follow clear mathematical structure, enforce strict physical and numerical constraints, and support objective verification. The discipline requires constructing explicit models of physical systems and reasoning about geometry, spatial relationships, and material behavior, connecting directly to emerging AI goals in physical reasoning and world modeling. We introduce FEM-Bench, a computational mechanics benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate correct finite element method (FEM) and related code. FEM-Bench 2025 contains a suite of introductory but nontrivial tasks aligned with material from a first graduate course on computational mechanics. These tasks capture essential numerical and physical modeling challenges while representing only a small fraction of the complexity present in the discipline. Despite their simplicity, state-of-the-art LLMs do not reliably solve all of them. In a five attempt run, the best performing model at function writing, Gemini 3 Pro, completed 30/33 tasks at least once and 26/33 tasks all five times. The best performing model at unit test writing, GPT-5, had an Average Joint Success Rate of 73.8%. Other popular models showed broad performance variation. FEM-Bench establishes a structured foundation for evaluating AI-generated scientific code, and future iterations will incorporate increasingly sophisticated tasks to track progress as models evolve.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables, 7 listings</p></details> |

We address this by introducing L-IVA (Long-horizon Interactive Visual Avatar), a task and benchmark for evaluating goal-directed planning in stochastic generative environments, and ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture), the first framework enabling active intelligence in video avatars. ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, validating our IWM-inspired design for advancing video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://xuanhuahe.github.io/ORCA/</p></details> |

However, current approaches in long video generation typically rely on window attention, which naively discards historical context outside the window, leading to catastrophic forgetting and scene inconsistency; conversely, retaining full history incurs prohibitive memory costs. To address this trade-off, we propose Memorize-and-Generate (MAG), a framework that decouples memory compression and frame generation into distinct tasks. Specifically, we train a memory model to compress historical information into a compact KV cache, and a separate generator model to synthesize subsequent frames utilizing this compressed representation. Furthermore, we introduce MAG-Bench to strictly evaluate historical memory retention.

Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation. All data and code will be released at https://github.com/earth-insights/SegEarth-R2.</p></details> |  |

This work provides a comprehensive overview of physical AI, establishing clear distinctions between theoretical physics reasoning and applied physical understanding while systematically examining how physics-grounded methods enhance AI's real-world comprehension across structured symbolic reasoning, embodied systems, and generative models. Through rigorous analysis of recent advances, we advocate for intelligent systems that ground learning in both physical principles and embodied reasoning processes, transcending pattern recognition toward genuine understanding of physical laws.

However, the reconstruction-oriented representation learning tangles perception with planning tasks, leading to suboptimal optimization for planning. To address this challenge, we propose WorldRFT, a planning-oriented latent world model framework that aligns scene representation learning with planning via a hierarchical planning decomposition and local-aware interactive refinement mechanism, augmented by reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RFT) to enhance safety-critical policy performance. Specifically, WorldRFT integrates a vision-geometry foundation model to improve 3D spatial awareness, employs hierarchical planning task decomposition to guide representation optimization, and utilizes local-aware iterative refinement to derive a planning-oriented driving policy. Furthermore, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which applies trajectory Gaussianization and collision-aware rewards to fine-tune the driving policy, yielding systematic improvements in safety. WorldRFT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both open-loop nuScenes and closed-loop NavSim benchmarks. On nuScenes, it reduces collision rates by 83% (0.30% -> 0.05%). On NavSim, using camera-only sensors input, it attains competitive performance with the LiDAR-based SOTA method DiffusionDrive (87.8 vs. 88.1 PDMS).</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026, first version</p></details> |

Deep learning-based watermarking has improved robustness to diffusion-based image editing, but a gap remains when a watermarked image is converted to video by image-to-video (I2V), in which per-frame watermark detection weakens. I2V has quickly advanced from short, jittery clips to multi-second, temporally coherent scenes, and it now serves not only content creation but also world-modeling and simulation workflows, making cross-modal watermark recovery crucial. We present WaTeRFlow, a framework tailored for robustness under I2V. It consists of (i) FUSE (Flow-guided Unified Synthesis Engine), which exposes the encoder-decoder to realistic distortions via instruction-driven edits and a fast video diffusion proxy during training, (ii) optical-flow warping with a Temporal Consistency Loss (TCL) that stabilizes per-frame predictions, and (iii) a semantic preservation loss that maintains the conditioning signal. Experiments across representative I2V models show accurate watermark recovery from frames, with higher first-frame and per-frame bit accuracy and resilience when various distortions are applied before or after video generation.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents InDRiVE, a DreamerV3-style MBRL agent that performs reward-free pretraining in CARLA using only intrinsic motivation derived from latent ensemble disagreement. Disagreement acts as a proxy for epistemic uncertainty and drives the agent toward under-explored driving situations, while an imagination-based actor-critic learns a planner-free exploration policy directly from the learned world model. After intrinsic pretraining, we evaluate zero-shot transfer by freezing all parameters and deploying the pretrained exploration policy in unseen towns and routes. We then study few-shot adaptation by training a task policy with limited extrinsic feedback for downstream objectives (lane following and collision avoidance). Experiments in CARLA across towns, routes, and traffic densities show that disagreement-based pretraining yields stronger zero-shot robustness and robust few-shot collision avoidance under town shift and matched interaction budgets, supporting the use of intrinsic disagreement as a practical reward-free pretraining signal for reusable driving world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Word to World: Can Large Language Models be Implicit Text-based World Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18832v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic reinforcement learning increasingly relies on experience-driven scaling, yet real-world environments remain non-adaptive, limited in coverage, and difficult to scale. World models offer a potential way to improve learning efficiency through simulated experience, but it remains unclear whether large language models can reliably serve this role and under what conditions they meaningfully benefit agents. We study these questions in text-based environments, which provide a controlled setting to reinterpret language modeling as next-state prediction under interaction. We introduce a three-level framework for evaluating LLM-based world models: (i) fidelity and consistency, (ii) scalability and robustness, and (iii) agent utility. Across five representative environments, we find that sufficiently trained world models maintain coherent latent state, scale predictably with data and model size, and improve agent performance via action verification, synthetic trajectory generation, and warm-starting reinforcement learning. Meanwhile, these gains depend critically on behavioral coverage and environment complexity, delineating clear boundry on when world modeling effectively supports agent learning.</p></details> |  |

This calls for wireless world models that can predict and roll out channel dynamics, for which multi-step channel state information (CSI) prediction offers a practical short-horizon look-ahead. Recent advances in foundation sequence models further motivate large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose dynamics learners when suitably adapted to non-text time-series signals. However, bridging CSI to LLMs is non-trivial because an effective adapter must expose informative spectral and temporal evolution patterns, while prior designs provide limited inductive bias to capture such channel structures. To this end, we propose SCA-LLM, a spectral-attentive LLM-based wireless world modeling framework that bridges CSI to LLMs via a spectral-channel attention (SCA) adapter. Specifically, the SCA adapter performs multi-spectral representation learning to extract informative channel features and align CSI with the LLM's sequence modeling capability, enabling parameter-efficient adaptation while keeping the LLM backbone largely frozen. Extensive simulations show that SCA-LLM achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance and strong zero-shot generalization, yielding up to -2.4 dB normalized mean squared error (NMSE) advantage over the previous LLM based method. Our ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed SCA adapter in mitigating domain mismatch.</p></details> |  |

Towards Autonomous Legal Agents in Venture Capital](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18658v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Before closing venture capital financing rounds, lawyers conduct diligence that includes tying out the capitalization table: verifying that every security (for example, shares, options, warrants) and issuance term (for example, vesting schedules, acceleration triggers, transfer restrictions) is supported by large sets of underlying legal documentation. While LLMs continue to improve on legal benchmarks, specialized legal workflows, such as capitalization tie-out, remain out of reach even for strong agentic systems. The task requires multi-document reasoning, strict evidence traceability, and deterministic outputs that current approaches fail to reliably deliver. We characterize capitalization tie-out as an instance of a real-world benchmark for legal AI, analyze and compare the performance of existing agentic systems, and propose a world model architecture toward tie-out automation-and more broadly as a foundation for applied legal intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChronoDreamer: Action-Conditioned World Model as an Online Simulator for Robotic Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18619v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ChronoDreamer, an action-conditioned world model for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Given a history of egocentric RGB frames, contact maps, actions, and joint states, ChronoDreamer predicts future video frames, contact distributions, and joint angles via a spatial-temporal transformer trained with MaskGIT-style masked prediction. Contact is encoded as depth-weighted Gaussian splat images that render 3D forces into a camera-aligned format suitable for vision backbones. At inference, predicted rollouts are evaluated by a vision-language model that reasons about collision likelihood, enabling rejection sampling of unsafe actions before execution. We train and evaluate on DreamerBench, a simulation dataset generated with Project Chrono that provides synchronized RGB, contact splat, proprioception, and physics annotations across rigid and deformable object scenarios. Qualitative results demonstrate that the model preserves spatial coherence during non-contact motion and generates plausible contact predictions, while the LLM-based judge distinguishes collision from non-collision trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Super Encoding Network: Recursive Association of Multi-Modal Encoders for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07576v2)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video understanding has been considered as one critical step towards world modeling, which is an important long-term problem in AI research. Recently, multimodal foundation models have shown such potential via large-scale pretraining. These models effectively align encoders of different modalities via contrastive learning. To further enhance performance on complex target movements and diversified video scenes, we propose to augment this alignment with deeper multimodal interactions, which are critical for understanding complex target movements with diversified video scenes. To fill this gap, we propose a unified Super Encoding Network (SEN) for video understanding, which builds up such distinct interactions through the recursive association of multimodal encoders in the foundation models. Specifically, we creatively treat those well-trained encoders as ``super neurons" in our SEN. Via designing a Recursive Association (RA) block, we progressively fuse multi-modalities with the input video, based on knowledge integrating, distributing, and prompting of super neurons in a recursive manner. In this way, our SEN can effectively encode deeper multimodal interactions for prompting various video understanding tasks in the downstream. Extensive experiments show that our SEN can remarkably boost the four most representative video tasks, including tracking, recognition, chatting, and editing, e.g., for pixel-level tracking, the average jaccard index improves 2.7%, and temporal coherence(TC) drops by 8.8% compared to the popular CaDeX++ approach. For one-shot video editing, textual alignment improves 6.4%, and frame consistency increases by 4.1% compared to the Tune-A-Video approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models as Discounted Bayesian Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18489v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong few-shot generalization through in-context learning, yet their reasoning in dynamic and stochastic environments remains opaque. Prior studies mainly focus on static tasks and overlook the online adaptation required when beliefs must be continuously updated, which is a key capability for LLMs acting as world models or agents. We introduce a Bayesian filtering framework to evaluate online inference in LLMs. Our probabilistic probe suite spans both multivariate discrete distributions, such as dice rolls, and continuous distributions, such as Gaussian processes, where ground-truth parameters shift over time. We find that while LLM belief updates resemble Bayesian posteriors, they are more accurately characterized by an exponential forgetting filter with a model-specific discount factor smaller than one. This reveals systematic discounting of older evidence that varies significantly across model architectures. Although inherent priors are often miscalibrated, the updating mechanism itself remains structured and principled. We further validate these findings in a simulated agent task and propose prompting strategies that effectively recalibrate priors with minimal computational cost.</p></details> | Under submission |

Unlike prior Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that rely on abstract latent dynamics or delegate reasoning to language components, STORM grounds planning in explicit visual rollouts, enabling interpretable and foresight-driven decision-making. A diffusion-based VLA policy proposes diverse candidate actions, a generative video world model simulates their visual and reward outcomes, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) selectively refines plans through lookahead evaluation. Experiments on the SimplerEnv manipulation benchmark demonstrate that STORM achieves a new state-of-the-art average success rate of 51.0 percent, outperforming strong baselines such as CogACT. Reward-augmented video prediction substantially improves spatio-temporal fidelity and task relevance, reducing Frechet Video Distance by over 75 percent. Moreover, STORM exhibits robust re-planning and failure recovery behavior, highlighting the advantages of search-guided generative world models for long-horizon robotic manipulation.</p></details> | Under submission |

However, Successful execution of such tasks depends on large, costly collections of real demonstrations, especially for fine-grained manipulation of articulated objects. To address this, we present AOMGen, a scalable data generation framework for articulated manipulation which is instantiated from a single real scan, demonstration and a library of readily available digital assets, yielding photoreal training data with verified physical states. The framework synthesizes synchronized multi-view RGB temporally aligned with action commands and state annotations for joints and contacts, and systematically varies camera viewpoints, object styles, and object poses to expand a single execution into a diverse corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning VLA policies on AOMGen data increases the success rate from 0% to 88.7%, and the policies are tested on unseen objects and layouts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Deep Predicate Invention with Pre-trained Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17992v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon robotic tasks are hard due to continuous state-action spaces and sparse feedback. Symbolic world models help by decomposing tasks into discrete predicates that capture object properties and relations. Existing methods learn predicates either top-down, by prompting foundation models without data grounding, or bottom-up, from demonstrations without high-level priors. We introduce UniPred, a bilevel learning framework that unifies both. UniPred uses large language models (LLMs) to propose predicate effect distributions that supervise neural predicate learning from low-level data, while learned feedback iteratively refines the LLM hypotheses. Leveraging strong visual foundation model features, UniPred learns robust predicate classifiers in cluttered scenes. We further propose a predicate evaluation method that supports symbolic models beyond STRIPS assumptions. Across five simulated and one real-robot domains, UniPred achieves 2-4 times higher success rates than top-down methods and 3-4 times faster learning than bottom-up approaches, advancing scalable and flexible symbolic world modeling for robotics.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Dexterous World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17907v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has made it easy to create realistic digital twins from everyday environments. However, current digital twins remain largely static and are limited to navigation and view synthesis without embodied interactivity. To bridge this gap, we introduce Dexterous World Model (DWM), a scene-action-conditioned video diffusion framework that models how dexterous human actions induce dynamic changes in static 3D scenes. Given a static 3D scene rendering and an egocentric hand motion sequence, DWM generates temporally coherent videos depicting plausible human-scene interactions. Our approach conditions video generation on (1) static scene renderings following a specified camera trajectory to ensure spatial consistency, and (2) egocentric hand mesh renderings that encode both geometry and motion cues to model action-conditioned dynamics directly. To train DWM, we construct a hybrid interaction video dataset. Synthetic egocentric interactions provide fully aligned supervision for joint locomotion and manipulation learning, while fixed-camera real-world videos contribute diverse and realistic object dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that DWM enables realistic and physically plausible interactions, such as grasping, opening, and moving objects, while maintaining camera and scene consistency. This framework represents a first step toward video diffusion-based interactive digital twins and enables embodied simulation from egocentric actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: snuvclab.github.io/dwm</p></details> |

Even modest per-step planning delays can destabilize control and degrade overall performance. We propose a speculation-and-correction framework that adapts the predict-then-verify philosophy of speculative execution to model-based control with TD-MPC2. At each step, a pretrained world model and latent-space MPC planner generate a short-horizon action queue together with predicted latent rollouts, allowing the agent to execute multiple planned actions without immediate replanning. When a new observation arrives, the system measures the mismatch between the encoded real latent state and the queued predicted latent. For small to moderate mismatch, a lightweight learned corrector applies a residual update to the speculative action, distilled offline from a replanning teacher. For large mismatch, the agent safely falls back to full replanning and clears stale action queues. We study both a gated two-tower MLP corrector and a temporal Transformer corrector to address local errors and systematic drift. Experiments on the DMC Humanoid-Walk task show that our method reduces the number of planning inferences from 500 to 282, improves end-to-end step latency by 25 percent, and maintains strong control performance with only a 7.1 percent return reduction. Ablation results demonstrate that speculative execution without correction is unreliable over longer horizons, highlighting the necessity of mismatch-aware correction for robust latency reduction.</p></details> | UIUC 25 Fall CS 498 |

While conventional approaches often prioritize pixel-level reconstruction of future scenes, such detailed rendering is computationally intensive and unnecessary for planning tasks like navigation. We therefore propose that prediction and planning can be efficiently performed directly within a latent space of high-level semantic representations. To realize this, we introduce the Representative Latent space Navigation World Model (ReL-NWM). Rather than relying on reconstructionoriented latent embeddings, our method leverages a pre-trained representation encoder, DINOv3, and incorporates specialized mechanisms to effectively integrate action signals and historical context within this representation space. By operating entirely in the latent domain, our model bypasses expensive explicit reconstruction and achieves highly efficient navigation planning. Experiments show state-of-the-art trajectory prediction and image-goal navigation performance on multiple benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate real-world applicability by deploying the system on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot, confirming its efficiency and robustness in practical navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Infrared images and fire masks provide complementary thermal and boundary information, yet current methods are predominantly limited to binary mask modeling with inherent signal sparsity, failing to capture the complex dynamics of fire. While world models show promise in video generation, their physical inconsistencies pose significant challenges for fire forecasting. This paper introduces PhysFire-WM, a Physics-informed World Model for emulating Fire spread dynamics. Our approach internalizes combustion dynamics by encoding structured priors from a Physical Simulator to rectify physical discrepancies, coupled with a Cross-task Collaborative Training strategy (CC-Train) that alleviates the issue of limited information in mask-based modeling. Through parameter sharing and gradient coordination, CC-Train effectively integrates thermal radiation dynamics and spatial boundary delineation, enhancing both physical realism and geometric accuracy. Extensive experiments on a fine-grained multimodal fire dataset demonstrate the superior accuracy of PhysFire-WM in fire spread prediction. Validation underscores the importance of physical priors and cross-task collaboration, providing new insights for applying physics-informed world models to disaster prediction.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods mainly fall into two categories: (1) static world generation models, which construct 3D environments without active agents, and (2) controllable-entity models, which allow a single entity to perform limited actions in an otherwise uncontrollable environment. In this work, we introduce AniX, leveraging the realism and structural grounding of static world generation while extending controllable-entity models to support user-specified characters capable of performing open-ended actions. Users can provide a 3DGS scene and a character, then direct the character through natural language to perform diverse behaviors from basic locomotion to object-centric interactions while freely exploring the environment. AniX synthesizes temporally coherent video clips that preserve visual fidelity with the provided scene and character, formulated as a conditional autoregressive video generation problem. Built upon a pre-trained video generator, our training strategy significantly enhances motion dynamics while maintaining generalization across actions and characters. Our evaluation covers a broad range of aspects, including visual quality, character consistency, action controllability, and long-horizon coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://snowflakewang.github.io/AniX/</p></details> |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide open-world semantic priors, they lack grounding in 3D geometry and temporal dynamics. Conversely, geometric perception captures structure and motion but remains semantically sparse. We propose SNOW (Scene Understanding with Open-World Knowledge), a training-free and backbone-agnostic framework for unified 4D scene understanding that integrates VLM-derived semantics with point cloud geometry and temporal consistency. SNOW processes synchronized RGB images and 3D point clouds, using HDBSCAN clustering to generate object-level proposals that guide SAM2-based segmentation. Each segmented region is encoded through our proposed Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP), producing multimodal tokens that capture localized semantic, geometric, and temporal attributes. These tokens are incrementally integrated into a 4D Scene Graph (4DSG), which serves as 4D prior for downstream reasoning. A lightweight SLAM backend anchors all STEP tokens spatially in the environment, providing the global reference alignment, and ensuring unambiguous spatial grounding across time. The resulting 4DSG forms a queryable, unified world model through which VLMs can directly interpret spatial scene structure and temporal dynamics. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that SNOW enables precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference, thereby setting new state-of-the-art performance in several settings, highlighting the importance of structured 4D priors for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[DriveVLA-W0: World Models Amplify Data Scaling Law in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12796v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However, VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose \textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment. We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a 680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size increases.</p></details> |  |

These models constitute the large majority of training compute and time and they are subsequently used to train actors entirely in simulation, but once this is done they are quickly discarded. We show in this work that utilising these models at inference time can significantly boost sample efficiency. We propose a novel approach that anticipates and actively seeks out informative states using the world model's short-horizon latent predictions, offering a principled alternative to traditional curiosity-driven methods that chase outdated estimates of high uncertainty states. While many model predictive control (MPC) based methods offer similar alternatives, they typically lack commitment, synthesising multiple multi-step plans at every step. To mitigate this, we present a hierarchical planner that dynamically decides when to replan, planning horizon length, and the commitment to searching entropy. While our method can theoretically be applied to any model that trains its own actors with solely model generated data, we have applied it to Dreamer to illustrate the concept. Our method finishes MiniWorld's procedurally generated mazes 50% faster than base Dreamer at convergence and in only 60% of the environment steps that base Dreamer's policy needs; it displays reasoned exploratory behaviour in Crafter, achieves the same reward as base Dreamer in a third of the steps; planning tends to improve sample efficiency on DeepMind Control tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages without appendix, 15 Figures, preprint</p></details> |

Prior work focused on first-generation AIE kernel optimizations, without tackling full neural network execution across the 2D array. In this work, we present AIE4ML, the first comprehensive framework for converting AI models automatically into optimized firmware targeting the AIE-ML generation devices, also with forward compatibility for the newer AIE-MLv2 architecture. At the single-kernel level, we attain performance close to the architectural peak. At the graph and system levels, we provide a structured parallelization method that can scale across the 2D AIE-ML fabric and exploit its dedicated memory tiles to stay entirely on-chip throughout the model execution. As a demonstration, we designed a generalized and highly efficient linear-layer implementation with intrinsic support for fused bias addition and ReLU activation. Also, as our framework necessitates the generation of multi-layer implementations, our approach systematically derives deterministic, compact, and topology-optimized placements tailored to the physical 2D grid of the device through a novel graph placement and search algorithm. Finally, the framework seamlessly accepts quantized models imported from high-level tools such as hls4ml or PyTorch while preserving bit-exactness. In layer scaling benchmarks, we achieve up to 98.6% efficiency relative to the single-kernel baseline, utilizing 296 of 304 AIE tiles (97.4%) of the device with entirely on-chip data movement. With evaluations across real-world model topologies, we demonstrate that AIE4ML delivers GPU-class throughput under microsecond latency constraints, making it a practical companion for ultra-low-latency environments such as trigger systems in particle physics experiments.</p></details> |  |

These multimodal memories enable them to recall past events, infer unobserved states, and integrate new information into context-dependent reasoning. Inspired by this capability, we introduce R4, a training-free framework for retrieval-augmented reasoning in 4D spatio-temporal space that equips vision-language models (VLMs) with structured, lifelong memory. R4 continuously constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time, yielding a persistent world model that can be shared across agents. At inference, natural language queries are decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal keys to retrieve relevant observations, which are integrated into the VLM's reasoning. Unlike classical retrieval-augmented generation methods, retrieval in R4 operates directly in 4D space, enabling episodic and collaborative reasoning without training. Experiments on embodied question answering and navigation benchmarks demonstrate that R4 substantially improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal information compared to baselines, advancing a new paradigm for embodied 4D reasoning in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

Existing metrics such as Frechet Video Distance (FVD) emphasize perceptual quality and overlook reasoning failures, including violations of causality, physics, and global consistency. We introduce MMGR (Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning Evaluation and Benchmark), a principled evaluation framework based on five reasoning abilities: Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, and Temporal. MMGR evaluates generative reasoning across three domains: Abstract Reasoning (ARC-AGI, Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (real-world 3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (sports and compositional interactions). MMGR applies fine-grained metrics that require holistic correctness across both video and image generation. We benchmark leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), revealing strong performance gaps across domains. Models show moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks but perform poorly on Abstract Reasoning (below 10 percent accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggle with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings. Our analysis highlights key limitations in current models, including overreliance on perceptual data, weak global state consistency, and objectives that reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR offers a unified diagnostic benchmark and a path toward reasoning-aware generative world models.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[OccSTeP: Benchmarking 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15621v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving requires a persistent understanding of 3D scenes that is robust to temporal disturbances and accounts for potential future actions. We introduce a new concept of 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP), which aims to address two tasks: (1) reactive forecasting: ''what will happen next'' and (2) proactive forecasting: "what would happen given a specific future action". For the first time, we create a new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios (e.g., erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames). To address this task, we propose OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model that maintains a dense voxel-based scene state and incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context over time. OccSTeP-WM leverages a linear-complexity attention backbone and a recurrent state-space module to capture long-range spatial dependencies while continually updating the scene memory with ego-motion compensation. This design enables online inference and robust performance even when historical sensor input is missing or noisy. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the OccSTeP concept and our OccSTeP-WM, yielding an average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain). The data and code will be open source at https://github.com/FaterYU/OccSTeP.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

We propose object-centric world models built with geometric algebra neural networks, providing a soft geometric inductive bias. Our models are evaluated using simulated environments of 2d rigid body dynamics with static obstacles, where we train for next-step predictions autoregressively. For long-horizon rollouts we show that the soft inductive bias of our models results in better performance in terms of physical fidelity compared to non-equivariant baseline models. The approach complements recent soft-equivariance ideas and aligns with the view that simple, well-chosen priors can yield robust generalization. These results suggest that geometric algebra offers an effective middle ground between hand-crafted physics and unstructured deep nets, delivering sample-efficient dynamics models for multi-object scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 11 figures; 6 pages supplementary material</p></details> |

In contrast to methods that rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate discrete occupancy tokens, which inherently limit representational capacity, our approach predicts multi-frame future occupancy in an end-to-end manner directly from raw image features. Inspired by the success of attention-based transformer architectures in foundational vision and language models such as GPT and VGGT, we employ a sparse occupancy representation that bypasses the intermediate bird's eye view (BEV) projection and its explicit geometric priors. This design allows the transformer to capture spatiotemporal dependencies more effectively. By avoiding both the finite-capacity constraint of discrete tokenization and the structural limitations of BEV representations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark for 1-3 second occupancy forecasting, outperforming existing approaches by a significant margin. Furthermore, it demonstrates robust scene dynamics understanding, consistently delivering high accuracy under arbitrary future trajectory conditioning.</p></details> |  |

WorldPlay draws power from three key innovations. 1) We use a Dual Action Representation to enable robust action control in response to the user's keyboard and mouse inputs. 2) To enforce long-term consistency, our Reconstituted Context Memory dynamically rebuilds context from past frames and uses temporal reframing to keep geometrically important but long-past frames accessible, effectively alleviating memory attenuation. 3) We also propose Context Forcing, a novel distillation method designed for memory-aware model. Aligning memory context between the teacher and student preserves the student's capacity to use long-range information, enabling real-time speeds while preventing error drift. Taken together, WorldPlay generates long-horizon streaming 720p video at 24 FPS with superior consistency, comparing favorably with existing techniques and showing strong generalization across diverse scenes.

While prior work largely focuses on pixel-space world models, these approaches face practical limitations in GUI settings, where predicting complex visual elements in future states is often difficult. In this work, we explore an alternative formulation of world modeling for GUI agents, where state transitions are described in natural language rather than predicting raw pixels. First, we introduce MobileWorldBench, a benchmark that evaluates the ability of vision-language models (VLMs) to function as world models for mobile GUI agents. Second, we release MobileWorld, a large-scale dataset consisting of 1.4M samples, that significantly improves the world modeling capabilities of VLMs. Finally, we propose a novel framework that integrates VLM world models into the planning framework of mobile agents, demonstrating that semantic world models can directly benefit mobile agents by improving task success rates.

Advances in large language models (LLMs) have established LLM-based agents as a major branch of MAS, enabling major breakthroughs in complex problem solving and world modeling. However, the reliability implications of this shift remain largely unexplored. i.e., whether substituting traditional agents with LLM-based agents can effectively enhance the reliability of MAS. In this work, we investigate and quantify the reliability of LLM-based agents from the perspective of Byzantine fault tolerance. We observe that LLM-based agents demonstrate stronger skepticism when processing erroneous message flows, a characteristic that enables them to outperform traditional agents across different topological structures. Motivated by the results of the pilot experiment, we design CP-WBFT, a confidence probe-based weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism to enhance the stability of MAS with different topologies. It capitalizes on the intrinsic reflective and discriminative capabilities of LLMs by employing a probe-based, weighted information flow transmission method to improve the reliability of LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CP-WBFT achieves superior performance across diverse network topologies under extreme Byzantine conditions (85.7\% fault rate). Notably, our approach surpasses traditional methods by attaining remarkable accuracy on various topologies and maintaining strong reliability in both mathematical reasoning and safety assessment tasks.</p></details> |  |

We present Cross-Trace Verification Protocol (CTVP), a novel AI control framework that verifies untrusted code-generating models through semantic orbit analysis. Rather than directly executing potentially malicious code, CTVP leverages the model's own predictions of execution traces across semantically equivalent program transformations. By analyzing consistency patterns in these predicted traces, we detect behavioral anomalies indicative of backdoors. Our approach introduces the Adversarial Robustness Quotient (ARQ), which quantifies the computational cost of verification relative to baseline generation, demonstrating exponential growth with orbit size. Theoretical analysis establishes information-theoretic bounds showing non-gamifiability -- adversaries cannot improve through training due to fundamental space complexity constraints. This work demonstrates that semantic orbit analysis provides a scalable, theoretically grounded approach to AI control for code generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 Pa...</summary><p>13 Pages, Initial Work on AI Control.

We introduce DexWM, a Dexterous Manipulation World Model that predicts the next latent state of the environment conditioned on past states and dexterous actions. To overcome the scarcity of dexterous manipulation datasets, DexWM is trained on over 900 hours of human and non-dexterous robot videos. To enable fine-grained dexterity, we find that predicting visual features alone is insufficient; therefore, we introduce an auxiliary hand consistency loss that enforces accurate hand configurations. DexWM outperforms prior world models conditioned on text, navigation, and full-body actions, achieving more accurate predictions of future states. DexWM also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to unseen manipulation skills when deployed on a Franka Panda arm equipped with an Allegro gripper, outperforming Diffusion Policy by over 50% on average in grasping, placing, and reaching tasks.</p></details> |  |

A world model should possess three essential properties: controllability, long-term visual quality, and temporal consistency. To this end, we take a progressive approach-first enhancing controllability and then extending toward long-term, high-quality generation. We present LongVie 2, an end-to-end autoregressive framework trained in three stages: (1) Multi-modal guidance, which integrates dense and sparse control signals to provide implicit world-level supervision and improve controllability; (2) Degradation-aware training on the input frame, bridging the gap between training and long-term inference to maintain high visual quality; and (3) History-context guidance, which aligns contextual information across adjacent clips to ensure temporal consistency. We further introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 100 high-resolution one-minute videos covering diverse real-world and synthetic environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LongVie 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, temporal coherence, and visual fidelity, and supports continuous video generation lasting up to five minutes, marking a significant step toward unified video world modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://vchitect.github.io/LongVie2-project/</p></details> |

Here we propose a mechanistic model of human mental rotation, leveraging advances in deep, equivariant, and neuro-symbolic learning. Our model consists of three stacked components: (1) an equivariant neural encoder, taking images as input and producing 3D spatial representations of objects, (2) a neuro-symbolic object encoder, deriving symbolic descriptions of objects from these spatial representations, and (3) a neural decision agent, comparing these symbolic descriptions to prescribe rotation simulations in 3D latent space via a recurrent pathway. Our model design is guided by the abundant experimental literature on mental rotation, which we complemented with experiments in VR where participants could at times manipulate the objects to compare, providing us with additional insights into the cognitive process of mental rotation. Our model captures well the performance, response times and behavior of participants in our and others' experiments. The necessity of each model component is shown through systematic ablations. Our work adds to a recent collection of deep neural models of human spatial reasoning, further demonstrating the potency of integrating deep, equivariant, and symbolic representations to model the human mind.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we present ORAD-3D, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest dataset specifically curated for off-road autonomous driving. ORAD-3D covers a wide spectrum of terrains, including woodlands, farmlands, grasslands, riversides, gravel roads, cement roads, and rural areas, while capturing diverse environmental variations across weather conditions (sunny, rainy, foggy, and snowy) and illumination levels (bright daylight, daytime, twilight, and nighttime). Building upon this dataset, we establish a comprehensive suite of benchmark evaluations spanning five fundamental tasks: 2D free-space detection, 3D occupancy prediction, rough GPS-guided path planning, vision-language model-driven autonomous driving, and world model for off-road environments. Together, the dataset and benchmarks provide a unified and robust resource for advancing perception and planning in challenging off-road scenarios. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/chaytonmin/ORAD-3D.</p></details> | Off-road robotics |
| **[Learning Autonomy: Off-Road Navigation Enhanced by Human Input](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18760v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the area of autonomous driving, navigating off-road terrains presents a unique set of challenges, from unpredictable surfaces like grass and dirt to unexpected obstacles such as bushes and puddles. In this work, we present a novel learning-based local planner that addresses these challenges by directly capturing human driving nuances from real-world demonstrations using only a monocular camera. The key features of our planner are its ability to navigate in challenging off-road environments with various terrain types and its fast learning capabilities. By utilizing minimal human demonstration data (5-10 mins), it quickly learns to navigate in a wide array of off-road conditions. The local planner significantly reduces the real world data required to learn human driving preferences. This allows the planner to apply learned behaviors to real-world scenarios without the need for manual fine-tuning, demonstrating quick adjustment and adaptability in off-road autonomous driving technology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta-Learning Online Dynamics Model Adaptation in Off-Road Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16923v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-speed off-road autonomous driving presents unique challenges due to complex, evolving terrain characteristics and the difficulty of accurately modeling terrain-vehicle interactions. While dynamics models used in model-based control can be learned from real-world data, they often struggle to generalize to unseen terrain, making real-time adaptation essential. We propose a novel framework that combines a Kalman filter-based online adaptation scheme with meta-learned parameters to address these challenges. Offline meta-learning optimizes the basis functions along which adaptation occurs, as well as the adaptation parameters, while online adaptation dynamically adjusts the onboard dynamics model in real time for model-based control. We validate our approach through extensive experiments, including real-world testing on a full-scale autonomous off-road vehicle, demonstrating that our method outperforms baseline approaches in prediction accuracy, performance, and safety metrics, particularly in safety-critical scenarios. Our results underscore the effectiveness of meta-learned dynamics model adaptation, advancing the development of reliable autonomous systems capable of navigating diverse and unseen environments.

| **[Self-Supervised Traversability Learning with Online Prototype Adaptation for Off-Road Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12109v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving reliable and safe autonomous driving in off-road environments requires accurate and efficient terrain traversability analysis. However, this task faces several challenges, including the scarcity of large-scale datasets tailored for off-road scenarios, the high cost and potential errors of manual annotation, the stringent real-time requirements of motion planning, and the limited computational power of onboard units. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel traversability learning method that leverages self-supervised learning, eliminating the need for manual annotation. For the first time, a Birds-Eye View (BEV) representation is used as input, reducing computational burden and improving adaptability to downstream motion planning. During vehicle operation, the proposed method conducts online analysis of traversed regions and dynamically updates prototypes to adaptively assess the traversability of the current environment, effectively handling dynamic scene changes. We evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art benchmarks on both public datasets and our own dataset, covering diverse seasons and geographical locations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms recent approaches. Additionally, real-world vehicle experiments show that our method operates at 10 Hz, meeting real-time requirements, while a 5.5 km autonomous driving experiment further validates the generated traversability cost maps compatibility with downstream motion planning.</p></details> |  |

This improves tracking performance and retention of inherent robustness of the model predictive controller. We evaluate this framework for off-road autonomous driving on unknown deformable terrains that represent sandy deformable soil, sandy and rocky soil, and cohesive clay-like deformable soil. Our findings demonstrate that our controller statistically outperforms standalone model-based and learning-based controllers by upto 29.2% and 10.2%.

| **[Motion planning for off-road autonomous driving based on human-like cognition and weight adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17820v1)** | 2024-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driving in an off-road environment is challenging for autonomous vehicles due to the complex and varied terrain. To ensure stable and efficient travel, the vehicle requires consideration and balancing of environmental factors, such as undulations, roughness, and obstacles, to generate optimal trajectories that can adapt to changing scenarios. However, traditional motion planners often utilize a fixed cost function for trajectory optimization, making it difficult to adapt to different driving strategies in challenging irregular terrains and uncommon scenarios. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive motion planner based on human-like cognition and cost evaluation for off-road driving. First, we construct a multi-layer map describing different features of off-road terrains, including terrain elevation, roughness, obstacle, and artificial potential field map. Subsequently, we employ a CNN-LSTM network to learn the trajectories planned by human drivers in various off-road scenarios. Then, based on human-like generated trajectories in different environments, we design a primitive-based trajectory planner that aims to mimic human trajectories and cost weight selection, generating trajectories that are consistent with the dynamics of off-road vehicles. Finally, we compute optimal cost weights and select and extend behavioral primitives to generate highly adaptive, stable, and efficient trajectories. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments in a desert off-road environment with complex terrain and varying road conditions. The experimental results show that the proposed human-like motion planner has excellent adaptability to different off-road conditions. It shows real-time operation, greater stability, and more human-like planning ability in diverse and challenging scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Sample Long Range Path Planning under Sensing Uncertainty for Off-Road Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11298v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We focus on the problem of long-range dynamic replanning for off-road autonomous vehicles, where a robot plans paths through a previously unobserved environment while continuously receiving noisy local observations. An effective approach for planning under sensing uncertainty is determinization, where one converts a stochastic world into a deterministic one and plans under this simplification. This makes the planning problem tractable, but the cost of following the planned path in the real world may be different than in the determinized world. This causes collisions if the determinized world optimistically ignores obstacles, or causes unnecessarily long routes if the determinized world pessimistically imagines more obstacles. We aim to be robust to uncertainty over potential worlds while still achieving the efficiency benefits of determinization. We evaluate algorithms for dynamic replanning on a large real-world dataset of challenging long-range planning problems from the DARPA RACER program. Our method, Dynamic Replanning via Evaluating and Aggregating Multiple Samples (DREAMS), outperforms other determinization-based approaches in terms of combined traversal time and collision cost. https://sites.google.com/cs.washington.edu/dreams/</p></details> |  |

Despite good performance in generic conditions, the state-of-the-art classifiers are often susceptible to (even) small perturbations, ultimately resulting in inaccurate predictions with high confidence. Prior research has directed their focus on making models more robust by modifying the architecture and training with noisy input images, but has not explored the influence of datasets in adversarial attacks. Our study aims to address this gap by examining the impact of non-robust features in off-road datasets and comparing the effects of adversarial attacks on different segmentation network architectures. To enable this, a robust dataset is created consisting of only robust features and training the networks on this robustified dataset. We present both qualitative and quantitative analysis of our findings, which have important implications on improving the robustness of machine learning models in off-road autonomous driving applications. Additionally, this work contributes to the safe navigation of autonomous robot Unimog U5023 in rough off-road unstructured environments by evaluating the robustness of segmentation outputs.

Rather than explicitly modelling and fusing each of these components, we instead consider an end-to-end approach via reinforcement learning (RL). However, collecting exploration driving data in the real world is impractical and dangerous. While training in simulation and deploying visual sim-to-real techniques has worked well for robot manipulation, deploying beyond controlled workspace viewpoints remains a challenge. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting Sim2Seg, a re-imagining of RCAN that crosses the visual reality gap for off-road autonomous driving, without using any real-world data. This is done by learning to translate randomized simulation images into simulated segmentation and depth maps, subsequently enabling real-world images to also be translated. This allows us to train an end-to-end RL policy in simulation, and directly deploy in the real-world. Our approach, which can be trained in 48 hours on 1 GPU, can perform equally as well as a classical perception and control stack that took thousands of engineering hours over several months to build. We hope this work motivates future end-to-end autonomous driving research.</p></details> | CoRL 2022 Paper |

By imitating a model predictive controller equipped with advanced sensors, we train a deep neural network control policy to map raw, high-dimensional observations to continuous steering and throttle commands. Compared with recent approaches to similar tasks, our method requires neither state estimation nor on-the-fly planning to navigate the vehicle. Our approach relies on, and experimentally validates, recent imitation learning theory. Empirically, we show that policies trained with online imitation learning overcome well-known challenges related to covariate shift and generalize better than policies trained with batch imitation learning. Built on these insights, our autonomous driving system demonstrates successful high-speed off-road driving, matching the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2018</p></details> |
| **[A View-Dependent Adaptive Matched Filter for LADAR-Based Vehicle Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08518v1)** | 2017-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LADARs mounted on mobile platforms produce a wealth of precise range data on the surrounding objects and vehicles. The challenge we address is to infer from these raw LADAR data the location and orientation of nearby vehicles. We propose a novel view-dependent adaptive matched filter for obtaining fast and precise measurements of target vehicle pose. We derive an analytic expression for the matching function which we optimize to obtain target pose and size. Our algorithm is fast, robust and simple to implement compared to other methods. When used as the measurement component of a tracker on an autonomous ground vehicle, we are able to track in excess of 50 targets at 10 Hz. Once targets are aligned using our matched filter, we use a support vector-based discriminator to distinguish vehicles from other objects. This tracker provides a key sensing component for our autonomous ground vehicles which have accumulated hundreds of miles of on-road and off-road autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proc....</summary><p>Proc. of 14th IASTED Int.

| **[A Self-Supervised Terrain Roughness Estimator for Off-Road Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6872v1)** | 2012-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a machine learning approach for estimating the second derivative of a drivable surface, its roughness. Robot perception generally focuses on the first derivative, obstacle detection. However, the second derivative is also important due to its direct relation (with speed) to the shock the vehicle experiences. Knowing the second derivative allows a vehicle to slow down in advance of rough terrain. Estimating the second derivative is challenging due to uncertainty. For example, at range, laser readings may be so sparse that significant information about the surface is missing. Also, a high degree of precision is required in projecting laser readings. This precision may be unavailable due to latency or error in the pose estimation. We model these sources of error as a multivariate polynomial. Its coefficients are learned using the shock data as ground truth -- the accelerometers are used to train the lasers. The resulting classifier operates on individual laser readings from a road surface described by a 3D point cloud. The classifier identifies sections of road where the second derivative is likely to be large. Thus, the vehicle can slow down in advance, reducing the shock it experiences. The algorithm is an evolution of one we used in the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge. We analyze it using data from that route.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)</p></details> |

| **[Reloc-VGGT: Visual Re-localization with Geometry Grounded Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21883v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual localization has traditionally been formulated as a pair-wise pose regression problem. Existing approaches mainly estimate relative poses between two images and employ a late-fusion strategy to obtain absolute pose estimates. However, the late motion average is often insufficient for effectively integrating spatial information, and its accuracy degrades in complex environments. In this paper, we present the first visual localization framework that performs multi-view spatial integration through an early-fusion mechanism, enabling robust operation in both structured and unstructured environments. Our framework is built upon the VGGT backbone, which encodes multi-view 3D geometry, and we introduce a pose tokenizer and projection module to more effectively exploit spatial relationships from multiple database views. Furthermore, we propose a novel sparse mask attention strategy that reduces computational cost by avoiding the quadratic complexity of global attention, thereby enabling real-time performance at scale. Trained on approximately eight million posed image pairs, Reloc-VGGT demonstrates strong accuracy and remarkable generalization ability. Extensive experiments across diverse public datasets consistently validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, delivering high-quality camera pose estimates in real time while maintaining robustness to unseen environments. Our code and models will be publicly released upon acceptance.https://github.com/dtc111111/Reloc-VGGT.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoGoPlanner: Localization Grounded Navigation Policy with Metric-aware Visual Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19629v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning in unstructured environments is a fundamental and challenging capability for mobile robots. Traditional modular pipelines suffer from latency and cascading errors across perception, localization, mapping, and planning modules. Recent end-to-end learning methods map raw visual observations directly to control signals or trajectories, promising greater performance and efficiency in open-world settings. However, most prior end-to-end approaches still rely on separate localization modules that depend on accurate sensor extrinsic calibration for self-state estimation, thereby limiting generalization across embodiments and environments. We introduce LoGoPlanner, a localization-grounded, end-to-end navigation framework that addresses these limitations by: (1) finetuning a long-horizon visual-geometry backbone to ground predictions with absolute metric scale, thereby providing implicit state estimation for accurate localization; (2) reconstructing surrounding scene geometry from historical observations to supply dense, fine-grained environmental awareness for reliable obstacle avoidance; and (3) conditioning the policy on implicit geometry bootstrapped by the aforementioned auxiliary tasks, thereby reducing error propagation. We evaluate LoGoPlanner in both simulation and real-world settings, where its fully end-to-end design reduces cumulative error while metric-aware geometry memory enhances planning consistency and obstacle avoidance, leading to more than a 27.3\% improvement over oracle-localization baselines and strong generalization across embodiments and environments. The code and models have been made publicly available on the https://steinate.github.io/logoplanner.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page:https://steinate.github.io/logoplanner.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Vision-Language-Policy Model for Dynamic Robot Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19178v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bridging the gap between natural language commands and autonomous execution in unstructured environments remains an open challenge for robotics. This requires robots to perceive and reason over the current task scene through multiple modalities, and to plan their behaviors to achieve their intended goals. Traditional robotic task-planning approaches often struggle to bridge low-level execution with high-level task reasoning, and cannot dynamically update task strategies when instructions change during execution, which ultimately limits their versatility and adaptability to new tasks. In this work, we propose a novel language model-based framework for dynamic robot task planning. Our Vision-Language-Policy (VLP) model, based on a vision-language model fine-tuned on real-world data, can interpret semantic instructions and integrate reasoning over the current task scene to generate behavior policies that control the robot to accomplish the task. Moreover, it can dynamically adjust the task strategy in response to changes in the task, enabling flexible adaptation to evolving task requirements. Experiments conducted with different robots and a variety of real-world tasks show that the trained model can efficiently adapt to novel scenarios and dynamically update its policy, demonstrating strong planning autonomy and cross-embodiment generalization.

However, it remains a longstanding challenge due to unstructured environments and the inherently complex terrain-vehicle interactions. Traditional physics-based methods struggle to accurately capture the nonlinear dynamics underlying these interactions, while purely data-driven approaches often overfit to specific motion patterns, vehicle geometries, or platforms, limiting their generalization in diverse, real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce AnyNav, a vision-based friction estimation and navigation framework grounded in neuro-symbolic principles. Our approach integrates neural networks for visual perception with symbolic physical models for reasoning about terrain-vehicle dynamics. To enable self-supervised learning in real-world settings, we adopt the imperative learning paradigm, employing bilevel optimization to train the friction network through physics-based optimization. This explicit incorporation of physical reasoning substantially enhances generalization across terrains, vehicle types, and operational conditions. Leveraging the predicted friction coefficients, we further develop a physics-informed navigation system capable of generating physically feasible, time-efficient paths together with corresponding speed profiles. We demonstrate that AnyNav seamlessly transfers from simulation to real-world robotic platforms, exhibiting strong robustness across different four-wheeled vehicles and diverse off-road environments.</p></details> |  |

While multi-modal sensor fusion provides comprehensive situational awareness yet robots must also contextualize their reasoning to achieve deep semantic understanding of complex scenes. Foundation model particularly Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as promising approach on integrating diverse perceptual modalities and spatio-temporal reasoning abilities to ground physical actions to realize General Physical Intelligence (GPI) across various robotic embodiments. Although GPI has been conceptually discussed in literature but its pivotal role and practical deployment in agile manufacturing remain underexplored. To address this gap, this practical review systematically surveys recent advances in VLA models through the lens of GPI by offering comparative analysis of leading implementations and evaluating their industrial readiness via structured ablation study. The state of the art is organized into six thematic pillars including multisensory representation learning, sim2real transfer, planning and control, uncertainty and safety measures and benchmarking. Finally, the review highlights open challenges and future directions for integrating GPI into industrial ecosystems to align with the vision of Industry 5.0 for intelligent, adaptive and collaborative manufacturing ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Advan...</summary><p>Advanced Engineering Informatics</p></details> |

However, a fundamental question remains: Can flying robots navigate in clutter using solely monocular RGB images? Given the prohibitive costs of real-world data collection, learning policies in simulation offers a promising path. Yet, deploying such policies directly in the physical world is hindered by the significant sim-to-real perception gap. Thus, we propose a framework that couples the photorealism of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) environments with Adversarial Domain Adaptation. By training in high-fidelity simulation while explicitly minimizing feature discrepancy, our method ensures the policy relies on domain-invariant cues. Experimental results demonstrate that our policy achieves robust zero-shot transfer to the physical world, enabling safe and agile flight in unstructured environments with varying illumination.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Vision-based module for accurately reading linear scales in a laboratory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15327v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capabilities and the number of vision-based models are increasing rapidly. And these vision models are now able to do more tasks like object detection, image classification, instance segmentation etc. with great accuracy. But models which can take accurate quantitative measurements form an image, as a human can do by just looking at it, are rare. For a robot to work with complete autonomy in a Laboratory environment, it needs to have some basic skills like navigation, handling objects, preparing samples etc. to match human-like capabilities in an unstructured environment. Another important capability is to read measurements from instruments and apparatus. Here, we tried to mimic a human inspired approach to read measurements from a linear scale. As a test case we have picked reading level from a syringe and a measuring cylinder. For a randomly oriented syringe we carry out transformations to correct the orientation. To make the system efficient and robust, the area of interest is reduced to just the linear scale containing part of the image. After that, a series of features were extracted like the major makers, the corresponding digits, and the level indicator location, from which the final reading was calculated. Readings obtained using this system were also compared against human read values of the same instances and an accurate correspondence was observed.</p></details> | 10 pages, 16 figures |

It plays a critical role in a wide range of applications, including indoor target search, mapping of extreme environments, resource exploration, etc. Despite significant progress in individual components, a holistic and practical description of a completely autonomous exploration system, encompassing both hardware and software, remains scarce. In this paper, we present GuangMing-Explorer, a fully integrated autonomous exploration platform designed for robust operation across diverse environments. We provide a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, including hardware design, software stack, algorithm deployment, and experimental configuration. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate the platform's effectiveness and efficiency in executing autonomous exploration tasks, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in complex and unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, published in ICUS2025</p></details> |
| **[A Network-Based Framework for Modeling and Analyzing Human-Robot Coordination Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15282v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studies of human-robot interaction in dynamic and unstructured environments show that as more advanced robotic capabilities are deployed, the need for cooperative competencies to support collaboration with human problem-holders increases. Designing human-robot systems to meet these demands requires an explicit understanding of the work functions and constraints that shape the feasibility of alternative joint work strategies. Yet existing human-robot interaction frameworks either emphasize computational support for real-time execution or rely on static representations for design, offering limited support for reasoning about coordination dynamics during early-stage conceptual design. To address this gap, this article presents a novel computational framework for analyzing joint work strategies in human-robot systems by integrating techniques from functional modeling with graph-theoretic representations. The framework characterizes collective work in terms of the relationships among system functions and the physical and informational structure of the work environment, while explicitly capturing how coordination demands evolve over time. Its use during conceptual design is demonstrated through a case study in disaster robotics, which shows how the framework can be used to support early trade-space exploration of human-robot coordination strategies and to identify cooperative competencies that support flexible management of coordination overhead. These results show how the framework makes coordination demands and their temporal evolution explicit, supporting design-time reasoning about cooperative competency requirements and work demands prior to implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems. 12 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Dexterous Manipulation through Imitation Learning: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03515v5)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dexterous manipulation, which refers to the ability of a robotic hand or multi-fingered end-effector to skillfully control, reorient, and manipulate objects through precise, coordinated finger movements and adaptive force modulation, enables complex interactions similar to human hand dexterity. With recent advances in robotics and machine learning, there is a growing demand for these systems to operate in complex and unstructured environments. Traditional model-based approaches struggle to generalize across tasks and object variations due to the high dimensionality and complex contact dynamics of dexterous manipulation. Although model-free methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) show promise, they require extensive training, large-scale interaction data, and carefully designed rewards for stability and effectiveness. Imitation learning (IL) offers an alternative by allowing robots to acquire dexterous manipulation skills directly from expert demonstrations, capturing fine-grained coordination and contact dynamics while bypassing the need for explicit modeling and large-scale trial-and-error. This survey provides an overview of dexterous manipulation methods based on imitation learning, details recent advances, and addresses key challenges in the field. Additionally, it explores potential research directions to enhance IL-driven dexterous manipulation. Our goal is to offer researchers and practitioners a comprehensive introduction to this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>32pag...</summary><p>32pages, 6 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

However, accurate sensorless force estimation remains challenging due to inherent modeling errors and complex residual dynamics and friction. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose K-VARK (Kernelized Variance-Aware Residual Kalman filter), a novel approach that integrates a kernelized, probabilistic model of joint residual torques into an adaptive Kalman filter framework. Through Kernelized Movement Primitives trained on optimized excitation trajectories, K-VARK captures both the predictive mean and input-dependent heteroscedastic variance of residual torques, reflecting data variability and distance-to-training effects. These statistics inform a variance-aware virtual measurement update by augmenting the measurement noise covariance, while the process noise covariance adapts online via variational Bayesian optimization to handle dynamic disturbances. Experimental validation on a 6-DoF collaborative manipulator demonstrates that K-VARK achieves over 20% reduction in RMSE compared to state-of-the-art sensorless force estimation methods, yielding robust and accurate external force/torque estimation suitable for advanced tasks such as polishing and assembly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Compressive Tactile Subsampling: Enabling High Spatiotemporal Resolution in Scalable Robotic Skin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13847v3)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots require full-body, high-resolution tactile sensing to operate safely in unstructured environments, enabling reflexive responses and closed-loop control. However, the pixel counts needed for dense, large-area coverage limit readout rates of most tactile arrays to <100 Hz, hindering their use in high-speed tasks. We present Adaptive Compressive Tactile Subsampling (ACTS), a scalable and data-driven method that greatly enhances traditional tactile matrices by leveraging adaptive sensor sampling and sparse recovery. By adaptively allocating measurements to informative regions, ACTS is especially effective for spatially sparse signals common in real-world interactions. Tested on a 1024-pixel tactile sensor array (32x32), ACTS achieved frame rates up to 1,000 Hz, an 18X improvement over conventional raster scanning, with minimal reconstruction error. For the first time, ACTS enables wearable, large-area, high-density tactile sensing systems that can deliver high-speed results. We demonstrate rapid object classification within 20 ms of contact, high-speed projectile detection, ricochet angle estimation, and soft deformation tracking, in tactile and robotics applications, all using flexible, high-density tactile arrays. These include high-resolution tactile gloves, pressure insoles, and full-body configurations covering robotic arms and human-sized mannequins. We further showcase tactile-based closed-loop control by guiding a metallic ball to trace letters using tactile feedback and by executing tactile-only whole-hand reflexes on a fully sensorized LEAP hand to stabilize grasps, prevent slip, and avoid sharp objects, validating ACTS for real-time interaction and motion control. ACTS transforms standard, low-cost, and robust tactile sensors into high-speed systems enabling scalable, responsive, and adaptive tactile perception for robots and wearables operating in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 11 main figures, 16 supplemental figures, Videos can be accessed at https://tinyurl.com/ACTS-videos</p></details> |
| **[UMArm: Untethered, Modular, Portable, Soft Pneumatic Arm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11476v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic arms are essential to modern industries, however, their adaptability to unstructured environments remains limited. Soft robotic arms, particularly those actuated pneumatically, offer greater adaptability in unstructured environments and enhanced safety for human-robot interaction. However, current pneumatic soft arms are constrained by limited degrees of freedom, precision, payload capacity, and reliance on bulky external pressure regulators. In this work, a novel pneumatically driven rigid-soft hybrid arm, ``UMArm'', is presented. The shortcomings of pneumatically actuated soft arms are addressed by densely integrating high-force-to-weight-ratio, self-regulated McKibben actuators onto a lightweight rigid spine structure. The modified McKibben actuators incorporate valves and controllers directly inside, eliminating the need for individual pressure lines and external regulators, significantly reducing system weight and complexity. Full untethered operation, high payload capacity, precision, and directionally tunable compliance are achieved by the UMArm. Portability is demonstrated through a wearable assistive arm experiment, and versatility is showcased by reconfiguring the system into an inchworm robot. The results of this work show that the high-degree-of-freedom, external-regulator-free pneumatically driven arm systems like the UMArm possess great potential for real-world unstructured environments.</p></details> |  |

This work presents a solar-powered, fully autonomous USV featuring a novel syringe-based sampling architecture capable of acquiring 72 discrete, contamination-minimized water samples per mission. The vehicle incorporates a ROS 2 autonomy stack with GPS-RTK navigation, LiDAR and stereo-vision obstacle detection, Nav2-based mission planning, and long-range LoRa supervision, enabling dependable execution of sampling routes in unstructured environments. The platform integrates a behavior-tree autonomy architecture adapted from Nav2, enabling mission-level reasoning and perception-aware navigation. A modular 6x12 sampling system, controlled by distributed micro-ROS nodes, provides deterministic actuation, fault isolation, and rapid module replacement, achieving spatial coverage beyond previously reported USV-based samplers. Field trials in Achocalla Lagoon (La Paz, Bolivia) demonstrated 87% waypoint accuracy, stable autonomous navigation, and accurate physicochemical measurements (temperature, pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids) comparable to manually collected references. These results demonstrate that the platform enables reliable high-resolution sampling and autonomous mission execution, providing a scalable solution for aquatic monitoring in remote environments.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying these models in unstructured environments remains challenging due to the critical need for simultaneous task compliance and safety assurance, particularly in preventing potential collisions during physical interactions. In this work, we introduce a Vision-Language-Safe Action (VLSA) architecture, named AEGIS, which contains a plug-and-play safety constraint (SC) layer formulated via control barrier functions. AEGIS integrates directly with existing VLA models to improve safety with theoretical guarantees, while maintaining their original instruction-following performance. To evaluate the efficacy of our architecture, we construct a comprehensive safety-critical benchmark SafeLIBERO, spanning distinct manipulation scenarios characterized by varying degrees of spatial complexity and obstacle intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, AEGIS achieves a 59.16% improvement in obstacle avoidance rate while substantially increasing the task execution success rate by 17.25%. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we make our code, models, and the benchmark datasets publicly available at https://vlsa-aegis.github.io/.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

Our framework involves software infrastructure, hardware platforms, and open-source firmware to support a full-stack learning infrastructure and workflow. Extensive empirical results demonstrate robust flight and sim-to-real generalization under real-world disturbances. By reducing the entry barrier for deploying learning-based controllers on aerial robots, our work lays a practical foundation for advancing autonomous flight in dynamic and unstructured environments.</p></details> |  |

This thesis presents a traversability-aware navigation framework for the M4 robot platform that uses learned terrain analysis to generate energy-efficient paths avoiding difficult terrain.Our approach uses FAST-LIO for real-time localization, generating 2.5D elevation maps from LiDAR point clouds. A CNN-based model processes these elevation maps to estimate traversability scores, which are converted into navigation costs for path planning. A custom A* planner incorporates these costs alongside geometric distance and energy consumption to find paths that trade modest distance increases for substantial terrain quality improvements. Before system development, a platform-agnostic study compared LiDAR-based and camera-based SLAM using OptiTrack ground truth. Point cloud comparison through ICP alignment and cloud-to-mesh distance analysis demonstrated that LiDAR-based mapping achieves centimeter-level precision essential for elevation mapping, while camera-based approaches exhibited significantly higher geometric error. These findings directly resulted in the selection of LiDAR as the primary sensor to generate elevation maps. The complete pipeline integrates FAST-LIO localization, GPU-accelerated elevation mapping, CNN-based traversability estimation, and Nav2 navigation with a custom traversability-aware planner. Experimental results demonstrate that the system successfully avoids low traversability regions and accepts a few longer paths to achieve a reduction in terrain cost. This work establishes a foundation for intelligent terrain-aware navigation applicable to multi-modal robotic platforms.</p></details> | Master's thesis |

Vision-based approaches offer promising results for enabling prosthetic hands to interact more naturally with diverse objects in dynamic environments. Building on this foundation, the paper presents a vision-guided grasping algorithm for a prosthetic hand, integrating perception, planning, and control for dexterous manipulation. A camera mounted on the set up captures the scene, and a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)-based vision algorithm is employed to segment an object for grasping and define its bounding box. Grasp contact points are then computed by generating candidate trajectories using Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star algorithm, and selecting fingertip end poses based on the minimum Euclidean distance between these trajectories and the objects point cloud. Each finger grasp pose is determined independently, enabling adaptive, object-specific configurations. Damped Least Square (DLS) based Inverse kinematics solver is used to compute the corresponding joint angles, which are subsequently transmitted to the finger actuators for execution. This modular pipeline enables per-finger grasp planning and supports real-time adaptability in unstructured environments. The proposed method is validated in simulation, and experimental integration on a Linker Hand O7 platform.</p></details> |  |

| **[The Autonomy-Alignment Problem in Open-Ended Learning Robots: Formalising the Purpose Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02514v3)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence is enabling the development of increasingly autonomous robots capable of operating beyond engineered factory settings and into the unstructured environments of human life. This shift raises a critical autonomy-alignment problem: how to ensure that a robot's autonomous learning focuses on acquiring knowledge and behaviours that serve human practical objectives while remaining aligned with broader human values (e.g., safety and ethics). This problem remains largely underexplored and lacks a unifying conceptual and formal framework. Here, we address one of its most challenging instances of the problem: open-ended learning (OEL) robots, which autonomously acquire new knowledge and skills through interaction with the environment, guided by intrinsic motivations and self-generated goals. We propose a computational framework, introduced qualitatively and then formalised, to guide the design of OEL architectures that balance autonomy with human control. At its core is the novel concept of purpose, which specifies what humans (designers or users) want the robot to learn, do, or avoid, independently of specific task domains. The framework decomposes the autonomy-alignment problem into four tractable sub-problems: the alignment of robot purposes (hardwired or learnt) with human purposes; the arbitration between multiple purposes; the grounding of abstract purposes into domain-specific goals; and the acquisition of competence to achieve those goals. The framework supports formal definitions of alignment across multiple cases and proofs of necessary and sufficient conditions under which alignment holds. Illustrative hypothetical scenarios showcase the applicability of the framework for guiding the development of purpose-aligned autonomous robots.</p></details> | 33 pages, 5 figures |

This requires grounding language-based action queries to objects that both afford the requested function and can be physically retrieved. Existing approaches often rely on black-box models or fixed affordance labels, limiting transparency, controllability, and reliability for human-facing applications. We introduce CRAFT-E, a modular neuro-symbolic framework that composes a structured verb-property-object knowledge graph with visual-language alignment and energy-based grasp reasoning. The system generates interpretable grounding paths that expose the factors influencing object selection and incorporates grasp feasibility as an integral part of affordance inference. We further construct a benchmark dataset with unified annotations for verb-object compatibility, segmentation, and grasp candidates, and deploy the full pipeline on a physical robot. CRAFT-E achieves competitive performance in static scenes, ImageNet-based functional retrieval, and real-world trials involving 20 verbs and 39 objects. The framework remains robust under perceptual noise and provides transparent, component-level diagnostics.

| **[Heuristic Step Planning for Learning Dynamic Bipedal Locomotion: A Comparative Study of Model-Based and Model-Free Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00840v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents an extended framework for learning-based bipedal locomotion that incorporates a heuristic step-planning strategy guided by desired torso velocity tracking. The framework enables precise interaction between a humanoid robot and its environment, supporting tasks such as crossing gaps and accurately approaching target objects. Unlike approaches based on full or simplified dynamics, the proposed method avoids complex step planners and analytical models. Step planning is primarily driven by heuristic commands, while a Raibert-type controller modulates the foot placement length based on the error between desired and actual torso velocity. We compare our method with a model-based step-planning approach -- the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) controller. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach attains comparable or superior accuracy in maintaining target velocity (up to 80%), significantly greater robustness on uneven terrain (over 50% improvement), and improved energy efficiency. These results suggest that incorporating complex analytical, model-based components into the training architecture may be unnecessary for achieving stable and robust bipedal walking, even in unstructured environments.</p></details> |  |

Geometry-based methods often struggle with visually defined parts, occlusions, and unseen objects. We introduce OVAL-Grasp, a zero-shot open-vocabulary approach to task-oriented, affordance based grasping that uses large-language models and vision-language models to allow a robot to grasp objects at the correct part according to a given task. Given an RGB image and a task, OVAL-Grasp identifies parts to grasp or avoid with an LLM, segments them with a VLM, and generates a 2D heatmap of actionable regions on the object. During our evaluations, we found that our method outperformed two task oriented grasping baselines on experiments with 20 household objects with 3 unique tasks for each. OVAL-Grasp successfully identifies and segments the correct object part 95% of the time and grasps the correct actionable area 78.3% of the time in real-world experiments with the Fetch mobile manipulator. Additionally, OVAL-Grasp finds correct object parts under partial occlusions, demonstrating a part selection success rate of 80% in cluttered scenes. We also demonstrate OVAL-Grasp's efficacy in scenarios that rely on visual features for part selection, and show the benefit of a modular design through our ablation experiments.

| **[Situationally-Aware Dynamics Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19574v2)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robots operating in complex, unstructured environments face significant challenges due to latent, unobserved factors that obscure their understanding of both their internal state and the external world. Addressing this challenge would enable robots to develop a more profound grasp of their operational context. To tackle this, we propose a novel framework for online learning of hidden state representations, with which the robots can adapt in real-time to uncertain and dynamic conditions that would otherwise be ambiguous and result in suboptimal or erroneous behaviors. Our approach is formalized as a Generalized Hidden Parameter Markov Decision Process, which explicitly models the influence of unobserved parameters on both transition dynamics and reward structures. Our core innovation lies in learning online the joint distribution of state transitions, which serves as an expressive representation of latent ego- and environmental-factors. This probabilistic approach supports the identification and adaptation to different operational situations, improving robustness and safety. Through a multivariate extension of Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection, our method segments changes in the underlying data generating process governing the robot's dynamics. The robot's transition model is then informed with a symbolic representation of the current situation derived from the joint distribution of latest state transitions, enabling adaptive and context-aware decision-making. To showcase the real-world effectiveness, we validate our approach in the challenging task of unstructured terrain navigation, where unmodeled and unmeasured terrain characteristics can significantly impact the robot's motion. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real world reveal significant improvements in data efficiency, policy performance, and the emergence of safer, adaptive navigation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLM-SFD: VLM-Assisted Siamese Flow Diffusion Framework for Dual-Arm Cooperative Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13428v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dual-arm cooperative manipulation holds great promise for tackling complex real-world tasks that demand seamless coordination and adaptive dynamics. Despite substantial progress in learning-based motion planning, most approaches struggle to generalize across diverse manipulation tasks and adapt to dynamic, unstructured environments, particularly in scenarios involving interactions between two objects such as assembly, tool use, and bimanual grasping. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel VLM-Assisted Siamese Flow Diffusion (VLM-SFD) framework for efficient imitation learning in dual-arm cooperative manipulation. The proposed VLM-SFD framework exhibits outstanding adaptability, significantly enhancing the ability to rapidly adapt and generalize to diverse real-world tasks from only a minimal number of human demonstrations. Specifically, we propose a Siamese Flow Diffusion Network (SFDNet) employs a dual-encoder-decoder Siamese architecture to embed two target objects into a shared latent space, while a diffusion-based conditioning process - conditioned by task instructions - generates two-stream object-centric motion flows that guide dual-arm coordination. We further design a dynamic task assignment strategy that seamlessly maps the predicted 2D motion flows into 3D space and incorporates a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to adaptively assign the optimal motion to each robotic arm over time. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its ability to generalize to diverse manipulation tasks while maintaining high efficiency and adaptability.

This paper proposes a novel homogeneous Proportional-Integral-Derivative (hPID) control strategy tailored for MRMs to achieve robust and coordinated motion control. Unlike classical PID controllers, the hPID controller leverages the mathematical framework of homogeneous control theory to systematically enhance the stability and convergence properties of the closed-loop system, even in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances involved into a system in a homogeneous way. A homogeneous PID structure is designed, ensuring improved convergence of tracking errors through a graded homogeneity approach that generalizes traditional PID gains to nonlinear, state-dependent functions. Stability analysis is conducted using Lyapunov-based methods, demonstrating that the hPID controller guarantees global asymptotic stability and finite-time convergence under mild assumptions. Experimental results on a representative MRM model validate the effectiveness of the hPID controller in achieving high-precision trajectory tracking for both the mobile base and manipulator arm, outperforming conventional linear PID controllers in terms of response time, steady-state error, and robustness to model uncertainties. This research contributes a scalable and analytically grounded control framework for enhancing the autonomy and reliability of next-generation mobile manipulation systems in structured and unstructured environments.</p></details> |  |

One promising strategy to improve their energy economy is to leverage their natural (unactuated) dynamics using elastic elements. This work explores that concept by designing energy-optimal control inputs through a unified, multi-stage framework. It starts with a novel energy injection technique to identify passive motion patterns by harnessing the system's natural dynamics. This enables the discovery of passive solutions even in systems with energy dissipation caused by factors such as friction or plastic collisions. Building on these passive solutions, we then employ a continuation approach to derive energy-optimal control inputs for the fully actuated, dissipative robotic system. The method is tested on simulated models to demonstrate its applicability in both single- and multi-legged robotic systems. This analysis provides valuable insights into the design and operation of elastic legged robots, offering pathways to improve their efficiency and adaptability by exploiting the natural system dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint Version, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), accepted November 2025</p></details> |

This paper presents FlexiCup, a fully wireless multimodal suction cup that integrates dual-zone vision-tactile sensing. The central zone dynamically switches between vision and tactile modalities via illumination control for contact detection, while the peripheral zone provides continuous spatial awareness for approach planning. FlexiCup supports both vacuum and Bernoulli suction modes through modular mechanical configurations, achieving complete wireless autonomy with onboard computation and power. We validate hardware versatility through dual control paradigms. Modular perception-driven grasping across structured surfaces with varying obstacle densities demonstrates comparable performance between vacuum (90.0% mean success) and Bernoulli (86.7% mean success) modes. Diffusion-based end-to-end learning achieves 73.3% success on inclined transport and 66.7% on orange extraction tasks. Ablation studies confirm that multi-head attention coordinating dual-zone observations provides 13% improvements for contact-aware manipulation.

| **[GaRLILEO: Gravity-aligned Radar-Leg-Inertial Enhanced Odometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13216v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deployment of legged robots for navigating challenging terrains (e.g., stairs, slopes, and unstructured environments) has gained increasing preference over wheel-based platforms. In such scenarios, accurate odometry estimation is a preliminary requirement for stable locomotion, localization, and mapping. Traditional proprioceptive approaches, which rely on leg kinematics sensor modalities and inertial sensing, suffer from irrepressible vertical drift caused by frequent contact impacts, foot slippage, and vibrations, particularly affected by inaccurate roll and pitch estimation. Existing methods incorporate exteroceptive sensors such as LiDAR or cameras. Further enhancement has been introduced by leveraging gravity vector estimation to add additional observations on roll and pitch, thereby increasing the accuracy of vertical pose estimation. However, these approaches tend to degrade in feature-sparse or repetitive scenes and are prone to errors from double-integrated IMU acceleration. To address these challenges, we propose GaRLILEO, a novel gravity-aligned continuous-time radar-leg-inertial odometry framework. GaRLILEO decouples velocity from the IMU by building a continuous-time ego-velocity spline from SoC radar Doppler and leg kinematics information, enabling seamless sensor fusion which mitigates odometry distortion. In addition, GaRLILEO can reliably capture accurate gravity vectors leveraging a novel soft S2-constrained gravity factor, improving vertical pose accuracy without relying on LiDAR or cameras. Evaluated on a self-collected real-world dataset with diverse indoor-outdoor trajectories, GaRLILEO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly in vertical odometry estimation on stairs and slopes. We open-source both our dataset and algorithm to foster further research in legged robot odometry and SLAM. https://garlileo.github.io/GaRLILEO</p></details> |  |

Nav (Dead-End Recovery-aware Navigation), a novel approach to autonomous navigation in scenarios where dead-end detection and recovery are critical, particularly in unstructured environments where robots must handle corners, vegetation occlusions, and blocked junctions. DR. Nav introduces a proactive strategy for navigation in unmapped environments without prior assumptions. Our method unifies dead-end prediction and recovery by generating a single, continuous, real-time semantic cost map. Specifically, DR. Nav leverages cross-modal RGB-LiDAR fusion with attention-based filtering to estimate per-cell dead-end likelihoods and recovery points, which are continuously updated through Bayesian inference to enhance robustness. Unlike prior mapping methods that only encode traversability, DR. Nav explicitly incorporates recovery-aware risk into the navigation cost map, enabling robots to anticipate unsafe regions and plan safer alternative trajectories. We evaluate DR. Nav across multiple dense indoor and outdoor scenarios and demonstrate an increase of 83.33% in accuracy in detection, a 52.4% reduction in time-to-goal (path efficiency), compared to state-of-the-art planners such as DWA, MPPI, and Nav2 DWB.

| **[SBAMP: Sampling Based Adaptive Motion Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12022v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robotic systems must navigate complex, dynamic environments in real time, often facing unpredictable obstacles and rapidly changing conditions. Traditional sampling-based methods, such as RRT*, excel at generating collision-free paths but struggle to adapt to sudden changes without extensive replanning. Conversely, learning-based dynamical systems, such as the Stable Estimator of Dynamical Systems (SEDS), offer smooth, adaptive trajectory tracking but typically rely on pre-collected demonstration data, limiting their generalization to novel scenarios. This paper introduces Sampling-Based Adaptive Motion Planning (SBAMP), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by integrating RRT* for global path planning with a SEDS-based local controller for continuous, adaptive trajectory adjustment. Our approach requires no pre-trained datasets and ensures smooth transitions between planned waypoints, maintaining stability through Lyapunov-based guarantees. We validate SBAMP in both simulated environments and real hardware using the RoboRacer platform, demonstrating superior performance in dynamic obstacle scenarios, rapid recovery from perturbations, and robust handling of sharp turns. Experimental results highlight SBAMP's ability to adapt in real time without sacrificing global path optimality, providing a scalable solution for dynamic, unstructured environments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 13 figures |

In contrast, vision-based tactile sensors in robotics have been limited to simple planar geometries, with biomorphic designs remaining underexplored. To address this gap, we present SimTac, a physics-based simulation framework for the design and validation of biomorphic tactile sensors. SimTac consists of particle-based deformation modeling, light-field rendering for photorealistic tactile image generation, and a neural network for predicting mechanical responses, enabling accurate and efficient simulation across a wide range of geometries and materials. We demonstrate the versatility of SimTac by designing and validating physical sensor prototypes inspired by biological tactile structures and further demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple Sim2Real tactile tasks, including object classification, slip detection, and contact safety assessment. Our framework bridges the gap between bio-inspired design and practical realisation, expanding the design space of tactile sensors and paving the way for tactile sensing systems that integrate morphology and sensing to enable robust interaction in unstructured environments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches either depend on external motion capture systems or fail to generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce VisualMimic, a visual sim-to-real framework that unifies egocentric vision with hierarchical whole-body control for humanoid robots. VisualMimic combines a task-agnostic low-level keypoint tracker -- trained from human motion data via a teacher-student scheme -- with a task-specific high-level policy that generates keypoint commands from visual and proprioceptive input. To ensure stable training, we inject noise into the low-level policy and clip high-level actions using human motion statistics. VisualMimic enables zero-shot transfer of visuomotor policies trained in simulation to real humanoid robots, accomplishing a wide range of loco-manipulation tasks such as box lifting, pushing, football dribbling, and kicking. Beyond controlled laboratory settings, our policies also generalize robustly to outdoor environments.

| **[Local Path Planning with Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance in Unstructured Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07927v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obstacle avoidance and path planning are essential for guiding unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) through environments that are densely populated with dynamic obstacles. This paper develops a novel approach that combines tangentbased path planning and extrapolation methods to create a new decision-making algorithm for local path planning. In the assumed scenario, a UGV has a prior knowledge of its initial and target points within the dynamic environment. A global path has already been computed, and the robot is provided with waypoints along this path. As the UGV travels between these waypoints, the algorithm aims to avoid collisions with dynamic obstacles. These obstacles follow polynomial trajectories, with their initial positions randomized in the local map and velocities randomized between O and the allowable physical velocity limit of the robot, along with some random accelerations. The developed algorithm is tested in several scenarios where many dynamic obstacles move randomly in the environment. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed local path planning strategy by gradually generating a collision free path which allows the robot to navigate safely between initial and the target locations.</p></details> |  |

Developing robotic systems that emulate human-like operational characteristics through musculoskeletal structures has long been a research focus. In this study, we designed a novel lightweight tendon-driven musculoskeletal arm (LTDM-Arm), featuring a seven degree-of-freedom (DOF) skeletal joint system and a modularized artificial muscular system (MAMS) with 15 actuators. Additionally, we employed a Hilly-type muscle model and data-driven iterative learning control (DDILC) to learn and refine activation signals for repetitive tasks within a finite time frame. We validated the anti-interference capabilities of the musculoskeletal system through both simulations and experiments. The results show that the LTDM-Arm system can effectively achieve desired trajectory tracking tasks, even under load disturbances of 20 % in simulation and 15 % in experiments. This research lays the foundation for developing advanced robotic systems with human-like operational performance.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

In these settings, visual place recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability, demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and pose estimation.

In this paper, we propose a pipeline for generating automated reports in natural language utilizing various multi-modal sensors that solely relies on local models capable of being deployed on edge computing devices, thus preserving the privacy of all actors involved and eliminating the need for external services. In particular, we evaluate our implementation on a diverse dataset spanning multiple domains including indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation results.

However, most of the existing suckers lack high-fidelity perceptual and tactile sensing, which impedes them from resolving the fine-grained geometric features and interaction status of the target surface. This limits their robust performance with irregular objects and in complex, unstructured environments. Inspired by the adaptive structure and high-performance sensory capabilities of cephalopod suckers, in this paper, we propose a novel, intelligent sucker, named SuckTac, that integrates a camera-based tactile sensor directly within its optimized structure to provide high-density perception and robust suction. Specifically, through joint structure design and optimization and based on a multi-material integrated casting technique, a camera and light source are embedded into the sucker, which enables in-situ, high-density perception of fine details like surface shape, texture and roughness. To further enhance robustness and adaptability, the sucker's mechanical design is also optimized by refining its profile, adding a compliant lip, and incorporating surface microstructure. Extensive experiments, including challenging tasks such as robotic cloth manipulation and soft mobile robot inspection, demonstrate the superior performance and broad applicability of the proposed system.</p></details> |  |

Among bioinspired designs, earthworm locomotion has been extensively studied for its efficient peristaltic motion, enabling movement in confined and unstructured environments. Existing earthworm-inspired robots primarily utilize pneumatic actuation due to its high force-to-weight ratio and ease of implementation. However, these systems often rely on bulky, power-intensive electronic control units, limiting their practicality. In this work, we present an electronics-free, earthworm-inspired pneumatic robot utilizing a modified Pneumatic Logic Gate (PLG) design. By integrating preconfigured PLG units with bellow actuators, we achieved a plug-and-play style modular system capable of peristaltic locomotion without external electronic components. The proposed design reduces system complexity while maintaining efficient actuation. We characterize the bellow actuators under different operating conditions and evaluate the robots locomotion performance. Our findings demonstrate that the modified PLG-based control system effectively generates peristaltic wave propagation, achieving autonomous motion with minimal deviation. This study serves as a proof of concept for the development of electronics-free, peristaltic soft robots. The proposed system has potential for applications in hazardous environments, where untethered, adaptable locomotion is critical. Future work will focus on further optimizing the robot design and exploring untethered operation using onboard compressed air sources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference Proceedings Paper Living Machines 2025</p></details> |

Existing data-driven approaches often fail to generalize, constrained by narrowly focused task demonstrations or inefficient random exploration. We introduce SoftAE, an uncertainty-aware active exploration framework that autonomously learns task-agnostic and generalizable dynamics models of soft robotic systems. SoftAE employs probabilistic ensemble models to estimate epistemic uncertainty and actively guides exploration toward underrepresented regions of the state-action space, achieving efficient coverage of diverse behaviors without task-specific supervision. We evaluate SoftAE on three simulated soft robotic platforms -- a continuum arm, an articulated fish in fluid, and a musculoskeletal leg with hybrid actuation -- and on a pneumatically actuated continuum soft arm in the real world. Compared with random exploration and task-specific model-based reinforcement learning, SoftAE produces more accurate dynamics models, enables superior zero-shot control on unseen tasks, and maintains robustness under sensing noise, actuation delays, and nonlinear material effects. These results demonstrate that uncertainty-driven active exploration can yield scalable, reusable dynamics models across diverse soft robotic morphologies, representing a step toward more autonomous, adaptable, and data-efficient control in compliant robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Robot Collaboration in Unstructured Environments with Grounded Generative Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26915v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous robot teams operating in realistic settings often must accomplish complex missions requiring collaboration and adaptation to information acquired online. Because robot teams frequently operate in unstructured environments -- uncertain, open-world settings without prior maps -- subtasks must be grounded in robot capabilities and the physical world. While heterogeneous teams have typically been designed for fixed specifications, generative intelligence opens the possibility of teams that can accomplish a wide range of missions described in natural language. However, current large language model (LLM)-enabled teaming methods typically assume well-structured and known environments, limiting deployment in unstructured environments. We present SPINE-HT, a framework that addresses these limitations by grounding the reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of a heterogeneous robot team through a three-stage process. Given language specifications describing mission goals and team capabilities, an LLM generates grounded subtasks which are validated for feasibility. Subtasks are then assigned to robots based on capabilities such as traversability or perception and refined given feedback collected during online operation. In simulation experiments with closed-loop perception and control, our framework achieves nearly twice the success rate compared to prior LLM-enabled heterogeneous teaming approaches. In real-world experiments with a Clearpath Jackal, a Clearpath Husky, a Boston Dynamics Spot, and a high-altitude UAV, our method achieves an 87\% success rate in missions requiring reasoning about robot capabilities and refining subtasks with online feedback.

Although the reinforcement learning is able to obtain impressive results, its stability and reliability is hard to guarantee, which would cause the potential safety threats. Besides, the transfer from simulation to real world also will lead in unpredictable situations. To enhance the safety and reliability of robots, we introduce the force and haptic perception into reinforcement learning. Force and tactual sensation play key roles in robotic dynamic control and human-robot interaction. We demonstrate that the force-based reinforcement learning method can be more adaptive to environment, especially in sim-to-real transfer. Experimental results show in object pushing task, our strategy is safer and more efficient in both simulation and real world, thus it holds prospects for a wide variety of robotic applications.</p></details> |  |

Conventional algorithmic approaches often require extensive environment-specific tuning, limiting scalability to new domains. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) provides a data-driven alternative, allowing robots to acquire navigation strategies through direct interactions with their environment. This work investigates the feasibility of DRL policy generalization across visually and topographically distinct simulated domains, where policies are trained in terrestrial settings and validated in a zero-shot manner in extraterrestrial environments. A 3D simulation of an agricultural rover is developed and trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to achieve goal-directed navigation and obstacle avoidance in farmland settings. The learned policy is then evaluated in a lunar-like simulated environment to assess transfer performance. The results indicate that policies trained under terrestrial conditions retain a high level of effectiveness, achieving close to 50\% success in lunar simulations without the need for additional training and fine-tuning. This underscores the potential of cross-domain DRL-based policy transfer as a promising approach to developing adaptable and efficient autonomous navigation for future planetary exploration missions, with the added benefit of minimizing retraining costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures.

The effectiveness of the method has been validated through simulations in an urban environment, showing accurate and compact predictions without relying on prior assumptions or prior training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>64th ...</summary><p>64th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control</p></details> |
| **[Risk Assessment of an Autonomous Underwater Snake Robot in Confined Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19415v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing interest in ocean discovery imposes a need for inspection and intervention in confined and demanding environments. Eely's slender shape, in addition to its ability to change its body configurations, makes articulated underwater robots an adequate option for such environments. However, operation of Eely in such environments imposes demanding requirements on the system, as it must deal with uncertain and unstructured environments, extreme environmental conditions, and reduced navigational capabilities. This paper proposes a Bayesian approach to assess the risks of losing Eely during two mission scenarios. The goal of this work is to improve Eely's performance and the likelihood of mission success. Sensitivity analysis results are presented in order to demonstrate the causes having the highest impact on losing Eely.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, Accepted for publication in OCEANS 2023 - Limerick</p></details> |
| **[Robobench: A Comprehensive Evaluation Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models as Embodied Brain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17801v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building robots that can perceive, reason, and act in dynamic, unstructured environments remains a core challenge. Recent embodied systems often adopt a dual-system paradigm, where System 2 handles high-level reasoning while System 1 executes low-level control. In this work, we refer to System 2 as the embodied brain, emphasizing its role as the cognitive core for reasoning and decision-making in manipulation tasks. Given this role, systematic evaluation of the embodied brain is essential. Yet existing benchmarks emphasize execution success, or when targeting high-level reasoning, suffer from incomplete dimensions and limited task realism, offering only a partial picture of cognitive capability. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoboBench, a benchmark that systematically evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as embodied brains. Motivated by the critical roles across the full manipulation pipeline, RoboBench defines five dimensions-instruction comprehension, perception reasoning, generalized planning, affordance prediction, and failure analysis-spanning 14 capabilities, 25 tasks, and 6092 QA pairs. To ensure realism, we curate datasets across diverse embodiments, attribute-rich objects, and multi-view scenes, drawing from large-scale real robotic data. For planning, RoboBench introduces an evaluation framework, MLLM-as-world-simulator. It evaluate embodied feasibility by simulating whether predicted plans can achieve critical object-state changes. Experiments on 14 MLLMs reveal fundamental limitations: difficulties with implicit instruction comprehension, spatiotemporal reasoning, cross-scenario planning, fine-grained affordance understanding, and execution failure diagnosis. RoboBench provides a comprehensive scaffold to quantify high-level cognition, and guide the development of next-generation embodied MLLMs. The project page is in https://robo-bench.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Embodiment Gaps: Deploying Vision-Language-Action Models on Soft Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17369v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic systems are increasingly expected to operate in human-centered, unstructured environments where safety, adaptability, and generalization are essential. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have been proposed as a language guided generalized control framework for real robots. However, their deployment has been limited to conventional serial link manipulators. Coupled by their rigidity and unpredictability of learning based control, the ability to safely interact with the environment is missing yet critical. In this work, we present the deployment of a VLA model on a soft continuum manipulator to demonstrate autonomous safe human-robot interaction. We present a structured finetuning and deployment pipeline evaluating two state-of-the-art VLA models (OpenVLA-OFT and $π_0$) across representative manipulation tasks, and show while out-of-the-box policies fail due to embodiment mismatch, through targeted finetuning the soft robot performs equally to the rigid counterpart. Our findings highlight the necessity of finetuning for bridging embodiment gaps, and demonstrate that coupling VLA models with soft robots enables safe and flexible embodied AI in human-shared environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 SpaVLE workshop. 4 pages, 2 figures(in main paper, excluding references and supplements)</p></details> |
